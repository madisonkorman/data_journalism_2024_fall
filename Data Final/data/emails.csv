My mother was a teenager when I was born and she struggled with addiction. I never met my father. But I had two incredible grandparents who stepped in and raised me. Everything I know, I learned from them. In every way a child needs, my grandparents were there for me. As they grew older, it was my privilege to be there for them. So, when I work to protect Medicare and Social Security, I do it with the personal knowledge of what those big programs meant in small but deeply meaningful ways to my grandparents. I know what they mean for your parents and grandparents. But let’s be clear: That is all at risk today. Right-wing extremists like Donald Trump and my opponent, Eric Hovde, want to bring us back in time. If they had it their way, they’d cut Social Security and Medicare. Overturn the Affordable Care Act. Further restrict our reproductive rights. Give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations while our working families foot the bill. We can’t let that happen, and as long as we stand together, I know we won’t. This November, we have the opportunity to move our country forward — to protect and expand affordable health care, restore reproductive rights, cut costs for working families, and protect Social Security and Medicare for our parents and grandparents. But it will take ALL of us.

Then, a new poll dropped showing that Scott isfavored by only 35% of Florida voters — double digits below DeSantis, Trump,and Rubio. That same day, he dumped another $725,000 into his campaigncoffers. Faced with these glaring issues around his reelection campaign, it'splain to see: Rick Scott is scared. I've said it before, and I'll say it again— we are in striking distance of flipping Florida's Senate seat blue. But upagainst the nine-figure personal fortune he's wielding to keep his campaignafloat, I can't get the job done without you. Will you please rush a gift nowto help me send Scott packing?https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk1729-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 If anything, friend, ""scared"" doesn't do itjustice. Rick Scott is downright TERRIFIED of our grassroots movement to flipFlorida blue. And between: * Polls that have shown us statistically tied formonths * A dire lack of enthusiasm, even from the most dedicated GOP voters *A DISTURBING track record in the Senate * The anticipation of high blue voterturnout to save abortion rights in Florida * And a MASSIVE surge of enthusiasmto end MAGA's grip on our country — he has very good reason to be. He's onlybeen in power this long because of the massive fortune, made off his company'scriminal Medicare fraud, he uses to keep it. It's the only way he knows how towin a general election; something he's never done with more than 1.15% of thevote — and that margin sinks with every race. And there's a direct linkbetween that ill-gained fortune and his consistently slim victories: No onecan relate to him. His policy positions — from a strict nationwide ban onabortions, to a tax plan that would kill crucial benefits and raise taxes byan average of $1,480 on the middle class when the cost of living is alreadytoo high — are simply out of touch. But that's just the thing, friend. Mostpeople simply can't compete with his multimillion-dollar campaign spending. Iknow I sure can't. But I didn't enter this race because I knew I could buy myway to the Senate. I'm running because, like me, Floridians are fed up withhis flimsy leadership and desperate thirst for power. We've had enough — and,friend that's why he's spending millions of dollars to beat me. I know I'vegot the message, the momentum, and the powerful grassroots movement to stophim, but only if I can count on your help to compete with his campaign cash.Before my midnight $125,000 fundraising deadline, will you please rush just $5or more to power me in the fight to retire Rick Scott, flip Florida, and keepthe Senate blue?https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk1729-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you for everything, Debbie -------- Thisemail was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

From thepassionate speeches to the sense of unity in the air, it’s clear thatprogressive Democrats across the country are ready to work for our future.This convention is a powerful reminder that–even in challenging times–ourbelief in a better tomorrow will carry us forward. As the song they playedlast night goes, “Don’t stop thinking about tomorrow!” But the work doesn’tstop there; It’s just beginning. Despite the good vibes at the convention, weknow this election will be a majorly uphill battle down the ballot. At the DNCwe’ve seen vibrant energy and smart policies for: affordable housing, betterhealthcare, lowered taxes and cost of living for working families and seniors,and improved K-12 and CTE education opportunities. We also know we have achance to restore abortion rights at a national level. As we transform theexcitement and hope from the DNC into our campaign here in rural Oregon, wemust remember that our fight is how we make those plans come to life in a waythat fits us. We can get these policies enacted if we win this election. Yoursupport is essential to keep that momentum going for the voters that need tohear it.

It's a gerrymandered state, where Republicans rely on voter suppression to maintain their chokehold on state politics. I'll explain more in a moment, but with the tides turning against the GOP, I know our movement has what it takes to win this race ... as long as I keep up with Rick Scott's massive fortune. Doing that means I can't afford to miss tonight's $4 million midnight deadline, so please: Will you chip in anything to split between me and Kirsten Gillibrand before midnight to help me flip Florida blue? https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gfs_dmp?refcode=jtk5315-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Over these past few months, I've spent just about every spare minute meeting even more voters as I travel up and down our beautiful state — and trust me, the majority of Florida voters don't support Rick Scott's far-right agenda. They DON'T believe in stripping people of their reproductive rights. They DON'T want to see their taxes go up while the top 1% gets a tax cut. They DON'T want to lose their Medicare and Social Security benefits. And they DON'T want leaders who sow division and scapegoat others to stay in power. But the Florida GOP has spent years gerrymandering our state to ensure that they hold on to power in Tallahassee, while totally ignoring what the majority of Floridians actually want. They convince us that our blue votes don't matter, to keep poll turnout low and voter disillusionment high. And then, the extremists who've gerrymandered their way into office pass more voter suppression bills, making it even harder for voters to cast their ballots with each election year. Why? Because Florida is NOT a red state. Now, friend, I need your help to prove it. So before my midnight deadline at 11:59 p.m., will you please chip in $5 or anything you can to split between me and Kirsten Gillibrand to help me build a winning grassroots campaign? Together, I know we can inspire Floridians to fight for better, break down the barriers keeping voters from the ballot box, retire Rick Scott, and flip this seat blue. https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gfs_dmp?refcode=jtk5315-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 None of this is possible without you — thank you, Debbie -------- This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

I've been feeling it in Dallas and San Antonio and all across Texas,too. That's how I know we're going to win this race. I've been saying sinceday one of this campaign that we're going to defeat Ted Cruz and protect ourSenate majority. Now, I need people like you behind me to get us across thefinish line. If you’re ready to kick Ted Cruz out of the Senate and protectour Democratic Senate majority, will you rush a split donation of $5 or morebetween my campaign and Jacky Rosen’s to help us continue building on thismomentum and win in November?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/rosenfornevada_allred?refcode=jtk4509-bu-text&amounts;=250,100,50,25,5 I’m honored to be the Democratic nominee for theU.S. Senate from Texas. I’m a fourth-generation Texan, and everything I’vedone in my life – from making it to the NFL, to law school, and finally toCongress – is thanks to opportunities that Texas has given me. In my Texas, webelieve that WE is more powerful than ME. But Ted Cruz doesn’t believe in theTexas that I know and love. He doesn’t believe you should help your neighborswhen things get tough. He doesn’t believe that our seniors deserve the SocialSecurity and Medicare benefits they have earned. He doesn’t believe that womenshould be able to make their own health care decisions. All Ted Cruz caresabout is himself – and Texas deserves much better than a me-guy who runs toCancun when we’re in crisis. Right now, we’re building the largest grassrootsteam Texas has ever seen so that we can defeat Ted Cruz and flip Texas blue.But he’s got an army of right-wing donors and far-right super PACs behind him,and I can’t win this race without your support. So please, if you're ready todefeat Ted Cruz, bring real leadership to Texas, and defend our narrow Senatemajority, will you rush a split donation of $5 or whatever you can affordbetween my campaign and Jacky Rosen’s right now?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/rosenfornevada_allred?refcode=jtk4509-bu-text&amounts;=250,100,50,25,5 Let's win this.

Friend,it’s Cory Booker. I’m writing today to ask you to support my friend andcolleague, Sherrod Brown, in his fight to win reelection in Ohio. From themoment I got to the Senate 11 years ago, Sherrod Brown has been a trustedpartner in the fight to make sure our country delivers on its promises for allAmericans, not just the wealthy elites. I’ve proudly fought by his side to endchild poverty, support unions, and call out racial disparities in our healthcare system. Working alongside Sherrod is incredibly inspiring. No matter whatwe’re up against, he wakes up every day ready to do whatever it takes todeliver for workers and families. Sherrod always says, “When you love thiscountry, you fight for the people who make it work.” And he puts in the work,day in and day out, to do just that. But Sherrod needs our help to keep upthis fight, friend. He’s up for reelection in what experts are saying could beone of the most competitive – and expensive – races this year. Republicans arespending record amounts to defeat him, and Sherrod is counting on grassrootssupporters like you to fight back. Please, will you chip in $5 or more to helpmy friend Sherrod Brown win in Ohio and keep fighting for working familiesacross the country? https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-wr-24?refcode=jtk2577-fr-text&amounts;=250,100,50,25,5 Look, here’s thesimple truth: If everyone reading this donated $5, Sherrod would reach hismidnight goal in no time, and we could stop sending emails like this one. Butnot everyone will, friend, and falling short of these critical fundraisinggoals simply isn’t an option with national Republicans like Mitch McConnelland Donald Trump going all in to defeat Sherrod and flip the Senate red.

43,Kirsten Engel,info@kirstenengel.com,Trump was at the border yesterday…,2024-08-23T18:16:26Z,2024,8,23,18,16,kirstenengel.com,"https://www.engelforarizona.com/ [https://www.engelforarizona.com/] Peter,Yesterday, former President Trump pretended he cares about securing theborder. He doesn’t. And neither does his loyal foot soldier, Juan Ciscomani.The Bipartisan Border Security bill was the most significant border securityreform in decades. It had the backing of both Republicans and Democrats. Andit was endorsed by the Border Patrol union. But then, the deal was sabotagedby former President Trump with help from Juan Ciscomani, my opponent. Trumpfeared the bill's success would undermine his ability to use the border as apolitical tool in his campaign, and Ciscomani and others like him were toowilling to obey by rejecting the deal out of hand. This is a clear example ofTrump and Ciscomani putting politics over people, even when the communitiesalong our border are in dire need of solutions. It's outrageous thatmeaningful legislation was killed for political gain, and it shows what we'vesuspected all along — some politicians don’t really want to solve thisproblem. Instead, they prefer to keep it alive as a talking point. It's alsotelling that Ciscomani didn’t even show up at yesterday’s media event, despitehis role in killing this crucial legislation (or maybe because of it). Itseems he’d rather be seen at private fundraisers with Trump and Speaker MikeJohnson, far from voters' scrutiny. Our border communities deserve better thanpolitical games. They deserve real solutions, and that's what I am committedto fighting for. Trump’s visit is going to mean a big influx of cash for myopponent.

My stomach is in knots – theDemocrats have already raised an astonishing $30 MILLION, and Kamala Harrisjust raised $100 million bucks(I know, I can’t believe anyone would give hermoney either…but they do). That’s why I’m humbly asking for your help: Willyou step up and chip in just a few bucks in the next hour to help us counterthis massive Left-wing onslaught? I’ll just tell you: I’m afraid to see whathappens if this email doesn’t work. The Democrats & the media hacks areterrified of me – that’s because as a young Hispanic female, I obliterateevery woke narrative they push. So, they will truly do anything to destroy me.The Democrats know that if they lose the Hispanic vote, it’s over for them.Forever. I’m opening my heart to you here: Please, please help out: CONTRIBUTEGod bless you, and God bless America.

Disaster In The Making ⚠️ Let’snot sugarcoat it—after watching the DNC, it’s glaringly obvious Vice PresidentKamala Harris is determined to drag America into the same far-left nightmareshehelped create in California. Her policies mirror the skyrocketing taxes,rampant homelessness, and economic wreckage of her “Golden State.” Now, she’sitching to unleash these failed ideas on the entire country. ""Kamalanomics""is a recipe for economic disaster. It’s riddled with reckless spending, job-killing regulations, and socialist-style price controls that would crush theAmerican Dream. Instead of fueling growth, she’s paving the road to governmentdependency and economic collapse. The evidence is clear—under her so-calledleadership with President Biden, our economyspiraled into chaos . Allowingher to further implement these samewackadoo policies with Gov. Tim Walz wouldbe a dadgum catastrophe for America. Her proposed handling of the cost-of-living crisis is another glaring example of just how out of touch she is.Rather than addressing the real issues, she scapegoats businesses andpushesfailed price controls. This isn’t just incompetence—it’s downrightdangerous. If Vice President Harris gets her way, our economy will crumble,and our freedoms will be under siege. Folks, the Harris-Walz ticket is justflat-out wrong for America—and it's a direct threat to everything we holddear. We must unite against their far-left agenda and fight to protect ournation from the disaster they’re determined to bring. The stakes couldn’t behigher. A Job Weld Done 👏 Credit: WBIR I had the honor of visiting WilliamBlount High School this week to recognize two remarkable young individuals—Lilly Dunn and Grayson Bradley—who are shining examples of what dedication toskilled trades can achieve. Lilly Dunn, an award-winning welder, and GraysonBradley, an award-winning construction worker, have both demonstratedexceptional talent and commitment in their fields. Lilly, who recentlygraduated and is now pursuing a degree in pipe fitting, won a gold medal inthe sculpture category at the national SkillsUSA welding contest in Atlanta.Her achievements are a testament to the value of hard work and skill, and itwas a privilege to speak with her and the other students about the rewardingopportunities available in the trades. Grayson, another recent graduate, hasalready started working full-time at a construction company and was part of ateam that won the bronze medal in a construction teamwork competition at theSkillsUSA competition. His story is a great example of how pursuing a careerin the trades can lead to immediate and fulfilling employment.

My former party came after me for the high crime ofstanding up to Hillary Clinton at the height of her power in 2016. A lot haschanged since then – for starters, I’m no longer a Democrat. Like so many, theDemocrat Party left me behind and became the Party of corporate elitists,warmongers, and anti-freedom propagandists.(In fact, I literally wrote thebook about doing what’s RIGHT for our country and LEAVING the Democrat Party!)The rot is too deep – it can’t be fixed, it must be driven out entirely.That’s why I’m sending you this email. I have a plan to bring down the ENTIREcabal of Elites running the Democrat Party. We need to raise 100K dollars bytonight so we can begin to put our plan into action. We’re short of that goalby about 7%. So – with a humble heart, a spine of steel, and love of our greatcountry – I respectfully ask you for a small contribution of 10 or 25 dollars.Will you stand with me? YES >> _NO >> We set this ambitious goal becausethis is a no-fail mission – we must defeat the Democrat elite at the ballotbox and send a powerful message that we, the people will not allow those whoare destroying our freedom to remain in power. Your contribution to our causeof freedom would make a tremendous difference. So I’m asking you: Can youplease help us? God bless you.

Find out why this Senate race is a MUST WIN. Fellow Conservative, 30years ago, I helped usher in a Republican takeover of the House ofRepresentatives. Today, I am asking you to help us bring about the same changein the United States Senate. One place that we can pick up a seat is via EricHovde in Wisconsin. Republicans have the BEST map they’ve had in a decade inthe Senate. There are 7 opportunities for us to FLIP Democrat held seats. In amoment I am going to ask you to join me in sending your personal endorsementto Eric Hovde but let me tell you why Eric Hovde and Wisconsin should be onyour radar in the final months of this cycle. Eric Hovde is a bornentrepreneur. Unlike his far-Left opponent, Tammy Baldwin, who has spent overthree decades in Washington, he’s built a business. But that’s not all – Erichas also dedicated his time to help troubled community banks. He’s helpedvulnerable children by providing shelter and care in Wisconsin and around theworld. He represents the type of compassion that Callista and I have workedhard to promote through faith and hard work. I know he’d make an amazingUnited States Senator – but right now, he’s been outraised and outspent bySenate Democrats and liberal dark money Super PACs determined to send TammyBaldwin back for a third term. So here’s my ask, Fellow Conservative. Will yousupport someone who wants to RESTORE THE AMERICAN DREAM, or let one ofKamala’s closest and most reliable supporters return to the Senate? SEND YOURENDORSEMENT FOR ERIC HOVDE >> Eric is putting the same tenacity to runningfor Senate as he has when he was building his businesses,but he cannot do thisalone. If he has any chance overcoming the millions flooding into one of themost important states for the road to the White House, he’ll need the supportof every conservative like you – even if it’s just a couple of bucks. So,Fellow Conservative, are you with me? Will you join me in supporting EricHovde to retire a career politician in the bag for the Harris-Walz agenda? Ihope you are.

Friend, The crisis on our southern border MUST end. It is not just a headline – it is a deadly reality affecting every community not just in New Mexico, but the entire country. Did you see our latest ad? We’re exposing Martin Heinrich’s reckless agenda and his betrayal of our national security. WATCH NOW » Here’s the truth: * Chinese labs are churning out deadly drugs. * Mexican cartels are smuggling these poisons across our border. * Martin Heinrich is making it worse by opposing crucial funding for our border agencies, throwing open the floodgates to these cartels, and unleashing a wave of illicit drugs and lawlessness into our communities. Heinrich’s negligence isdangerous, and the consequences have proved fatal. This election is our chance to take back control and put an end to these radical leftist policies that Martin Heinrich has forced upon New Mexico. Will you stand with me in this fight to secure our southern border? Chip in $25, $50, or even $100 today to help us fight back and secure our border once and for all. Every dollar you give helps us reach more voters, air more ads, and spread the truth about the dangers Martin Heinrich poses. This is our moment to protect New Mexico and our national security. In a race as close as this, we need all the support we can muster to defeat Martin Heinrich and take back the Senate majority. For New Mexico, Nella Domenici Republican for Senate ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici’s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella’s family’s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world’s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

But hell, if you want to click here and chip in right away, I'm not gonnastop you. I'll get right into it: Democrats are facing a NIGHTMARE Senate map.There's a strong chance it will all come down to Ohio, which means Sherrod isthe ONLY thing standing between us and a Mitch McConnell-led Senate. Olivia,I've worked on campaigns for a long time. I've been on the winning side andthe losing side. If there's one thing I know, it's that money makes a BIGdifference. I wish it weren't the case, but it is. TV ads, phone banks, yardsigns, campaign events in every corner of the state ... it all adds up FAST.That's why I'm so terrified right now. If this were a simple battle betweengood and evil, I wouldn't be worried – Sherrod is as good a leader as Ohioanshave ever had. He fights harder for workers than anybody I know, and he's notafraid to take on the big banks and corporations that are making things harderfor the middle class. But money muddies the waters, and his opponent has got aton of it. He's already poured A TON into his own campaign, and there's a lotmore where that came from. Sherrod simply doesn't have that kind of money – sothat's where this grassroots team needs to come in and have his back. I knowSherrod can win this critical race, but ONLY IF we all come together to givehim the resources he needs. So I'm asking: Will you rush $5, $25, or even $50to split between his campaign and Adam Frisch's to help him win in Ohio?[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_brown?refcode=em20240821pm-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=8098a0ed-f75f-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b]If you've saved payment information with ActBlue Express, your split donationbetween Sherrod Brown and Adam Frisch will go through immediately: DONATE $10[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_brown?refcode=em20240821pm-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&express;_lane=true&amount;=10&refcode2;=8098a0ed-f75f-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b]DONATE $25[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_brown?refcode=em20240821pm-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&express;_lane=true&amount;=25&refcode2;=8098a0ed-f75f-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b]DONATE $35[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_brown?refcode=em20240821pm-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&express;_lane=true&amount;=35&refcode2;=8098a0ed-f75f-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b]DONATE $50[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_brown?refcode=em20240821pm-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&express;_lane=true&amount;=50&refcode2;=8098a0ed-f75f-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b]DONATE $100[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_brown?refcode=em20240821pm-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&express;_lane=true&amount;=100&refcode2;=8098a0ed-f75f-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b]Other Amount[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_brown?refcode=em20240821pm-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=8098a0ed-f75f-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b]Thanks for doing your part – there's simply no other option!

I’mreaching out to see if you could split a donation of $7 or more between mycampaign and Seth Moulton to help us defend Montana’s Senate seat. Here are 7reasons why your donation today is so important (that’s one for everyfinger!): [http://secure.actblue.com/donate/moulton-tester] 1. Politicalexperts rank this race a toss-up , which means your gift will have a hugeimpact on our ability to raise the resources we need to win. 2. Tim Sheehy iswrong for Montana. He wants to privatize health care, sell off our publiclands, and would support a national abortion ban. 3. Mitch McConnell isdesperate to beat me. He named me one of his top targets, and outside groupsare spending millions to pummel me with attacks. 4. Their attacks are working.The polls have tightened into a statistical tie, and this race couldn’t be anycloser—your $7 will help us pull ahead. 5. I won my first Senate race by just3,562 votes… and this election could be even closer. 6. We’re less than 100days out from Election Day, and we’re falling behind in our fundraising. If wecan’t afford to keep our ads up, our opponent’s attacks will drown us out. 7.We can’t win without you. If every person reading this chipped in $7, we’dhave the resources we need to overcome the attacks, break our tie in thepolls, and win this race. But not everyone will, so I’m asking you personally:Can I count on you to make a split donation of $7 or more today between mycampaign and Seth Moulton? Your support today could mean the differencebetween victory and defeat.

Last night, before Vice President Kamala Harris gave her speech, Jason laid out exactly what Donald Trump wants to do if he wins this November. It’s called Project 2025, a 900-page document outlining every way extreme MAGA Republicans want to dramatically reshape the country. Their agenda does nothing to solve problems that Coloradans face, it only serves to consolidate power for Donald Trump and his allies. Jason also knows that Vice President Harris is the only candidate who will invest in us — in solving our most challenging problems, in fighting for our futures, in rebuilding our infrastructure, and restoring our freedoms. She represents the new generation of leaders that will take us into the future. Donald Trump represents old ways of thinking that will drag us back into the past.

Most people don't know I grew up in Springfield,Ohio. My mom was a seamstress and my dad was a factory worker, and I saw upclose how hard they worked to support our family.

Senate control will be determined by Sherrod's race, so we must standtogether to protect reproductive rights, defend Social Security and Medicare,and save our democracy. This race is going to be tight.

At the DNC, I delivered our campaign’s message to the whole nation—and stood firmly with our next President, Kamala Harris. Here’s what I said: My family’s story is America’s story. My father immigrated from Italy, went to college, was a navigator on a B-24 during World War II, came home, and was elected as the youngest judge in New York history at 28. What a country! It’s painful to me that immigration has become so polarizing. The border is broken, and this year we had a bipartisan border deal. But that deal was blocked by far-right extremists! Now, we have to come together to celebrate a candidate who knows America is worth it. Who knows this nation, built by immigrants, is a rare and beautiful thing, and who joyfully accepts the challenge to secure our border, to treat people like human beings, and to move our country forward. That’s Kamala Harris! But team, we need to make sure that Kamala Harris has a partner in Congress, and that means flipping the House! NY-03 is a must-win seat, and I’ll need your help to keep it. So team, can you split a donation between me and Kirsten Gillibrand right now to keep me in Congress and ensure Kamala Harris has a partner to pass her agenda? https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gfs_4_suozzi?refcode=jtk5324-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 We have a lot of work to do, and I need you by my side.

I’ve beenlearning a lot about the Midwest, how our government works, and why thiselection really matters. Last night, I got to be on the convention floor withthe Tennessee Delegation, and I even snapped a few pictures. One of myfavorites has President Obama in it. My mom’s a big fan of Michelle Obama, andseeing her light up when Michelle spoke was a moment I won’t forget. Here’sthe thing: this election isn’t just another one. It’s about making sure peoplelike my mom, Grandma, and little sister have the rights they deserve. I’m allin for Kamala Harris because having the first Black woman president would be agame-changer. Michelle Obama told us to “Do something.” So, I’m on a mission.I’m raising $3,000 to help the Tennessee Voter Project turn Tennessee blue andget Kamala Harris elected. Every dollar we get helps us register new voters,educate people, and make sure they show up when it counts. If you want to bepart of something that matters, now’s the time.

Every person deserves the right to retire with dignity. But too many people don’t have that option.

Aging Americans often have to rely on family members to care for them — moving into their homes or looking for financial support to cover massive assisted living costs. With the average Georgian making less than $52,000 a year, there is very little left in family budgets to pay for the care of aging parents and grandparents. That puts families in the difficult position of choosing between caring for their loved ones and saving for their own futures.

Mystomach is in knots – the Democrats have already raised an astonishing $30MILLION, and Kamala Harris just raised $100 million bucks(I know, I can’tbelieve anyone would give her money either…but they do). That’s why I’m humblyasking for your help: Will you step up and chip in just a few bucks in thenext hour to help us counter this massive Left-wing onslaught? I’ll just tellyou: I’m afraid to see what happens if this email doesn’t work. The Democrats& the media hacks are terrified of me – that’s because as a young Hispanicfemale, I obliterate every woke narrative they push. So, they will truly doanything to destroy me. The Democrats know that if they lose the Hispanicvote, it’s over for them. Forever. I’m opening my heart to you here: Please,please help out: CONTRIBUTE God bless you, and God bless America.

124,Dave McCormick,info@gopwinning.org,Can you take 1 minute to read this?,2024-08-21T21:30:26Z,2024,8,21,21,30,gopwinning.org,"This powerful story follows the journeys of two Army officers Friend, As I amon the campaign trail, I'm reminded of the great sacrifices that are madeevery day to defend our country. Today, I hope you’ll take just a few minutesto hear this personal story directly from me. Nearly four decades ago, duringmy time at West Point, I came across a book that left a lasting impact onme.It was ""Once an Eagle"" by Anton Myrer. This powerful story follows thejourneys of two Army officers – one who navigated his career driven solely bypersonal gain and advancement, and one who navigated his career by putting thewell-being of his fellow soldiers above all else. After graduating from WestPoint, I went into the Army. It was then that I truly reflected on this bookand one very important lesson it taught me. True leadership is not about you.It is about selfless service to others and to the mission. As a combat vet,the days are long and hard. You're deep in the heart of a grueling trek, theweight of your pack bearing down with each step. In the heat of the moment,even the smallest blister can feel like a mountain to overcome. As a platoonleader in the 82nd Airborne, I've been there. After hours of marching, it’snot easy to keep pushing through pain. But, no matter what, I remembered howimportant it was to check my soldiers’ feet before my own. Why? Because greatleaders ALWAYS put others' needs first. I’ve seen firsthand what greatleadership looks like. I’ve seen that even on our worst days, you have to putthe needs of others first. I’m running for Senate because Pennsylvania andAmerica need a strong leader — and I have what it takes to do the job which iswhy I’m hoping you’ll pitch in a donation of $17.76 or more today. Under theDemocrats’ leadership, times are tough. We’re experiencing skyrocketinginflating, unprecedented crime rates, open borders, and leadership that isdestroying the American Dream. America deserves better. You deserve better.It’s time for a strong leader who will step up to the plate, put Americanfamilies first, and fight for the future our great nation deserves. Will youjoin me today? I'm Dave McCormick. I'm a West Point grad, combat vet, 7th-generation Pennsylvanian, and business leader.Now, I’m running in the #1battleground race that WILL decide the Senate majority. I've been on toughmissions, but if I'm going to win my next mission to defeat a Democrat who'sspent 18 years in DC – and flip the Senate – I need your help. It would mean alot to me if every single person reading this could send a donation of just $5in order to show the strength of our movement during this critical fight forPennsylvania and our great nation’s future. Your donation will not only showthat my campaign is a force to be reckoned with, but it will also play a vitalrole in helping fund our campaign in the upcoming days and months. Will youconsider making a one-time donation of any amount today in support of my fightto save America? I know how to restore strong leadership in our countrybecause I’ve done it before.And I’ll do it as your next Senator. We canrevitalize the economy, support small businesses, stop Washington’s spendingsprees, protect our border, and save America’s future. But in order to get thejob done, it’s going to take all hands on deck. Democrats at every level areoutraising their GOP opponents. Schumer's allies have committed to spendwhatever it takes to obliterate my campaign because if I win, it'sIMPOSSIBLEfor Democrats to keep their Senate majority. That's why we need to fuel mycampaign and show the Democrats in power that we have what it takes to WINthis fight. Will you join me today? I've lived the American Dream, and Ican't sit back and watch it slip away for our kids. I need every freedom-loving American to help me reach the finish line. I promise I won't let youdown.

If Idon’t win, the State Senate will be tied 15-15. Arizona can’t afford to have afuture without school choice or low taxes. Mark my word, the Democrats willraise your taxes and whittle down our student’s current educational options.This week SPN is in town. I have enjoyed hearing about policy solutions beingused in other states. It has been great to refuel and learn about innovativeideas to solve some of our state’s growing problems. It was nice to stop bySPN and see some old friends and make some new acquaintances as well. Like oldand new friendships, to be successful in winning a campaign, it is all aboutaddition, not subtraction. Many people have asked me this week if I have setaside time to listen to the democrat convention. No, I haven’t been watchingthe DNC Convention, but I do hear clips on the radio and see their speechesposted online. The democrat whose name will be listed at the top of the tickethas supported horrible policies leading to chaos and homelessness in some ofour largest cities in America. Vice President Harris has complained aboutinflation, but hasn’t done anything to solve it. The VP is the deciding votein the US Senate if they need her to step in, right, and she is now on thecampaign trail complaining about inflation. The Democrats have allowed rampantillegal immigration, transnational gangs, illicit drugs, and crime to overtakeour streets. With all this being stated, the Democrats are energized rightnow. Thankfully, republicans offer a more positive message. To win this downballot race, we need every resource we can pull into our campaign. The BolickBrigade needs you. Do you have time to write post cards? Can you send textmessages to help with our Get out the vote apparatus? Would you like to helpus make phone calls to chase early mail-in ballots? Can you help with aliterature drop in your precinct? Can you host a meet and greet? If youanswered yes to any of these questions, just reply to this email how you’dlike to help, and we will put you to work. If you live in LD2, I would behonored if you could put up a yard sign (https://bolickforarizona.com/request-a-yard-sign?mc_cid=2c2cf8a60c&mc;_eid=UNIQID) endorsing us for the November5^th election. Your support adds up and will fuel our campaign to the end. Weare finalizing our budget. If you would like to invest(https://secure.anedot.com/vote-bolick-statesenateld2/donate?mc_cid=2c2cf8a60c&mc;_eid=UNIQID) in saving this state,I am the hardest campaigner and have a stellar legislative track record. SinceI was first elected in November 2018, I have been a champion for smallbusiness, lean government, and secure borders. In 2024, with a democratgovernor in office I had several pieces of legislation signed into law. Myleftwing democrat opponent has yet to have a single bill signed even with ademocrat governor. As a wife, mom, and champion for hardworking familiesthroughout Arizona, I have spent my career fighting for educational freedom.At the Capitol, I have led the charge in stopping inflation on food, gas, andrent, protecting our children, countering fentanyl abuse, and working to endhuman trafficking. I will continue to fight for common-sense solutions to thechallenges facing our community, from standing up for veterans to protectingour water supply. We have all witnessed the consequences of single party rule,which is why keeping a check on the Governor’s agenda provides more balancedpolicy for our communities. Together, we will build safer neighborhoods,strong schools, and great jobs. I have been endorsed by law enforcement, smallbusinesses, and teachers. I won’t let you down. I have enjoyed helping myconstituents navigate complex issues and overseeing them until they are in therearview mirror. Near the end of my July 30^th primary, my car died, so I havebeen renting a small SUV so they can fix the steering and who knows what elsein their diagnostic report. This has not stopped me from campaigning in theblistering heat. My husband and others can attest I had a heat rash during theprimary, and it still hasn’t dissipated this month.

It’s where I grew up, it’s where Terese and I raised our four daughters, and it’s where I’m proud to still call home today. Every week, when I make my way home from Washington, traveling on Amtrak and 476, Scranton is my final destination. When people ask why we chose to make Scranton our home, I tell them it's because of the people. When I’m grocery shopping, “hello” or “how’s it going?” in the checkout line always leads to an engaging conversation. Neighbors don’t just say “hello” back and go on with their day. They’re going to tell you about what they’re buying and about their family — and they’ll ask you about what you’re buying and about your family too. These conversations remind me how hard Pennsylvanians work to provide for their kids, save for their families’ futures, and give back to their communities. It reminds me why I’m fighting for the people of our Commonwealth in the Senate. They deserve a Senator on their side. Peter, I’m running for re-election to continue fighting for Pennsylvania families, but the reality is, this is my toughest race yet. My opponent is worth hundreds of millions of dollars and will be another “yes” vote for big corporations and the ultra-wealthy like him in the Senate. That’s why Wall Street billionaires are trying so hard to defeat me and flip this seat. GOP super PACs are already spending $75 million, and there’s more on the way.

I am proud tobe one of the many delegates standing behind Kamala Harris as she accepts hernomination. To offer some historical context, segregation was not officiallyoutlawed until 1964 — I was a young child, and our Presidential nominee KamalaHarris had just been born . Back then, Black women could not hold a positionof power — but that didn’t mean they weren’t powerful, Peter. Ourgrandmothers, mothers, aunts, and sisters all paved the way for us — stoking afire that has brought Kamala and me to greater heights than our ancestorscould have imagined. For the past 60 years, we have not only reclaimed ourpower, we have ushered in an era of impermeable progress. Now I’m representingmy home district in Congress, watching history unfold as Kamala Harrisredefines what it means to be President of the United States. I’m committed tomaking history forever, Peter. That starts with electing Democrats up and downthe ballot — will you help me defend my seat by chipping in $ or anything youcan afford today?

And with the stakes of this race being as high as they are, we’ve got to do everything we can to elect a government that fights for us. We’re mostly funded by supporters like you who are just as fired up as I am about winning this election.

But $5 makes a bigger difference than you think. It helps us: * ✅ Reach millions of Michiganders by knocking on doors and making calls * ✅ Support Democrats up and down the ballot who share our values * ✅ Travel to other swing states to support Team Harris-Walz * ✅ Spread our message and mobilize voters through advertising * ✅ Hold Donald Trump accountable by calling out his egregious lies When you donate $5, you’re joining a team of thousands of grassroots supporters who understand what’s at stake in this election. Individually, your donations may seem small — but together, your donations make a huge difference in our work to defeat Donald Trump and elect Democrats up and down the ballot who share our values. $5, or more if you can, will make a difference in helping us win.

And there's only one word that comes to mind: Hope. We refuse to go backwards – when we watched our democracy be threatened at the hands of insurrectionists, and our reproductive freedoms being taken away by the Supreme Court. But despite that, we have pushed and persevered to where we are now – where history is unfolding with the first Black and South Asian woman becoming the Democratic presidential nominee. Over the last four days here in Chicago, the energy has been through the roof. The excitement to defeat Donald Trump and make history is out of this world. Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, and all Democrats are ready to fight for everyday, working-class Americans who are tired of hearing about Donald Trump and Project 2025. We’re ready to make our country a place where everyone can feel safe and can get ahead. And we’re ready to protect our democracy from far-right extremists that will turn our government for all to a government for one: Donald Trump. That’s just… weird, to say the least. So with over two months until Election Day, the choice is yours to help Kamala and Tim get into the White House and defend our Democratic Senate. Will you chip in $10 or more to help us cross the finish line?

Kennedy, Jr. just announced at a Phoenix press conference that he is dropping out of the presidential race and endorsing Donald Trump. The facts speak for themselves: RFK Jr. did not even qualify for the ballot in 26 states. He selected a running mate with no political experience but a personal fortune she was all too willing to spend. For both of them, it was never more than an effort to call attention to themselves and their conspiracy theories. His popularity has all but collapsed after numerous bizarre campaign revelations, which I need not detail here. (But he did once file a frivolous lawsuit against Facebook where he mentioned me for opposing dangerous vaccine misinformation. He lost the lawsuit, and now, RFK Jr. is done in presidential politics.) RFK Jr. has dropped any pretense whatsoever of running his campaign on his own merits after his running mate openly wondered this week whether to “join forces” with Trump’s campaign to stop Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. “We draw votes from Trump,” she said. Now, they are openly working with Trump to help him win this election. Clearly, RFK Jr. is hoping Trump will appoint him to something. Anything.

We are unified, we are energized, and we are committed — but there’s still a long road to winning in November. This is going to be a close election. Every vote will matter. And in order to win, every one of us needs to stand together and do our part to elect VP Harris and Gov. Walz as our next president and vice president and elect Democratic candidates at every level of the ballot. I said early on that we would deliver North Carolina for this ticket and I’m sticking to it. I’m doing all I can to help our nominees win in North Carolina, and I firmly believe we can flip our state blue for the first presidential election since 2008. Our team is in place, we have a plan, and we’re ready to put in hard work. We can do it. But it’s up to us to get it done. I know firsthand that the way to win in NC is to connect with voters in every community. That’s why I’m personally asking if you can contribute any amount today to help me elect North Carolina Democrats. Our voter outreach efforts won’t be cheap, but they’re essential to winning tight races. [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/rc_email2024] Peter, the hope you’re feeling is real. When we elect Democrats this November, we’ll have the opportunity to continue our progress and move our country forward. Our Democratic candidates are ready to defend our fundamental rights and our democracy. They’ll work to make health care more affordable and accessible. They’ll advocate for better funding for our public schools so kids get the education they deserve. That matters. I’m honored to be in Chicago this week, Peter, and tomorrow I’ll address the convention hall and help make the case for Democrats at every level. There is so much good we can do together when we elect our next Democratic president and stop MAGA Republicans in their tracks. If you can, consider chipping in today to help us keep up the fight in North Carolina — one of the most competitive states on the ballot this year. I’m counting on you.

147,Tammy Baldwin,info@tinafororegon.com,I’m used to being written off,2024-08-22T15:32:08Z,2024,8,22,15,32,tinafororegon.com,"Tina for Oregon [https://nvlupin.blob.core.windows.net/images/van/NGP/NGP12/1/92654/images/TinaForOregon-Logo-FullColor-white.png] Hey Peter — Tina here! Senator Tammy Baldwin asked to reach out with an important message: I’m used to being written off, Peter. When I first ran for Congress in Wisconsin in 1997, no one thought I could win — especially when an extremely popular challenger jumped into the race. I remember huddling with one of my staffers at the time, and she said, “Well Tammy, maybe you want to rethink what you’re doing because it’s going to be tough.” I looked her right in the eye and asked, “Do you think I should wait my turn?” The next thing I said was this: I believe that women have to run — especially when it’s hard — and not wait our turn. We can’t wait until we get a tap on our shoulder or we’ll never get anywhere. I ended up winning that race and became the very first woman elected to the House of Representatives from Wisconsin. And it wouldn’t be the last time our team would make history. When I ran for U.S. Senate in 2012, an incredible team of grassroots supporters like you fought alongside me — even as some people wrote us off. You helped me become the first woman elected to the chamber from Wisconsin and the first openly gay Senator in our nation’s history. In 2018, despite being a top target for national Republicans and enduring over a year of attacks, you stood with me again, and we won. Time and again, grassroots supporters like you have helped us defy the odds. The battle to protect my seat this year will be no different, with this race being my toughest election yet. My opponent and his Republican allies have already spent more than $26 million to buy the seat I hold, and recent polls are showing this race in a dead heat. Protecting this seat won’t be easy, but together, I know we can defy the odds once again. So, Peter, I’m humbly asking: Will you make a donation to my re-election campaign today to help me protect my battleground seat and the Democratic majority in the U.S. Senate?

He has an unwaveringcommitment to fighting for what's right, whether that means bringingmanufacturing jobs back to America or holding big corporations accountable.He'll do whatever it takes to deliver for workers and families across ourcountry. But here's the problem: Sherrod is facing his toughest race yet, andexperts say the outcome could decide Senate control. Now, the GOP is attackinghim left and right, and National Republicans are on track to spend millions toflip this seat. With the election year heating up, Sherrod is falling short ofthe grassroots resources he needs to fight back and win.

The bill, pushed through by a progressive majority,imposes a sweeping array of restrictions on law-abiding gun owners, and areamong the most stringent anti-gun owner laws in the country. In the race forU.S. Senate, John Deaton has said he supports this anti-gun owner law puttinghim at odds with the Republican Party and a conservative movement who has beenstunned by the new legislation. Deaton’s anti-gun and anti-second amendmentstatements go as far as to say he supports this progressive bill. Ian Cainreleased the following statement on the new law: “I have been clear that Isupport common-sense laws that don’t impede on second amendment rights. Thisnew legislation is too radical and represents a dangerous overreach on ourconstitutional rights.” Cain added: “No real conservative would support thisinfringement on rights and criminalizing responsible gun owners. Deaton iswrong on this issue, and I hope voters understand he is not the right choicefor Massachusetts Republicans.” # # # Paid for by Ian Cain for Us () Copyright(C) 2024 Ian Cain for Us.

I wasserving as the president of Nevada’s largest synagogue, and looking back now,that was incredibly fitting – because my Jewish faith and values have alwaysbeen at the very core of my work in Congress. In fact, my decision to run forpublic office was guided by the Jewish principle of Tikkun Olam – to leave theworld a better place than how we found it. I’m so proud of the progress we'vemade in the years since. And in the face of growing antisemitism, attacks onreproductive freedom, and threats to tear down our democracy, I'm as committedas ever to making positive change happen. But I need your help. Right now,polling shows me locked in a statistical tie with Trump-endorsed candidate SamBrown – who set a major GOP fundraising record in this race that will likelydecide Senate control. So please, I'm humbly asking: If you're with me in thefight to continue making progress for the people and communities we love, willyou chip in $5 or more today to help me meet my $35,000 daily fundraisinggoal, defend my seat in Nevada, and keep the Senate blue?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/rosenfornevada_email_0824?refcode=jtk4485-fr-text&amounts;=250,100,50,25,5 It is a privilege to serve you and your lovedones.

While we heard multiple calls for aceasefire on the national stage receive thunderous applause, the DemocraticParty has yet to give any Palestinian speakers the representation theydeserve. Family members of Israeli hostages were given a platform to addressthe nation last night, and they used it to call for a ceasefire. By excludingPalestinians from making their voice heard at the Party’s convention, the DNCis suggesting that Israeli and Palestinian lives are NOT equal — this isracist and goes against our very values as Democrats. The only PalestinianAmerican in Congress, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, put it perfectly: [https://go.justicedemocrats.com/signup/20240822-dnc-palestinian-voices/?refcode=em20240822-35929&akid;=35929%2E1203867%2EHCna4G ]RashidaTlaib: .@DNC: Why are you saying that Israeli children are more valuable thanPalestinian children? Where is our shared humanity? Stop erasing Palestinians.We exist. We deserve to be heard. Later in the evening, Uncommitted delegatesthen confirmed there would not be a Palestinian speaker invited to the mainstage. Since then, they have bravely staged a sit-in outside the conventioncenter until their request is met. There's no excuse to justify excluding aPalestinian American voice from the DNC stage. This Party has an opportunityto show that it's different than Republicans, that it believes in democracythat includes Palestinian voices and opposes genocide—like a majority of itsvoters. Rashida and fellow Justice Democrats Cori Bush, Summer Lee, IlhanOmar, Jamaal Bowman, Delia Ramirez, Ayanna Pressley, and AOC are demandingParty leadership right this wrong by giving even a single Palestinian voice aplatform on the final night of this convention. Justice Democrats stands insolidarity with the Squad and the Uncommitted movement calling for theDemocratic Party to do the right thing by inviting a Palestinian to speak onthe main stage, pledging to enact an arms embargo, and urging the Harris-Walzcampaign to commit to a permanent ceasefire.

You might recognize me from your TV, buttoday, I'm reaching out as a proud Buckeye and American to ask you to supportVice President Kamala Harris and Sen. Sherrod Brown in the two most importantraces of the year. If you're with me, will you please split $5, $25 – whateveryou can spare – between Kamala’s campaign and Sherrod’s so they can win theirraces and continue the fight for our future?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sb4harris?amounts=250,100,50,25,5&refcode;=jtk2654-fr-text Now, more than ever, it's important for us to stand together in the faceof adversity, friend. Across the nation, we're seeing MAGA Republicans rollback reproductive rights, threaten to cut Social Security and Medicare, andattack our democracy. And GOP megadonors are spending millions to replaceDemocratic senators like Sherrod and put Donald Trump and JD Vance in theWhite House. There's so much at stake, friend, and with Election Day quicklyapproaching, we can't leave anything to chance. That's why I’m determined todo everything I can to keep Sherrod's voice in the Senate and put VicePresident Kamala Harris in the Oval Office. I believe it's crucial for us, ascitizens and as Democrats, to get involved in choosing the leaders who run ourcountry – from the Senate to the White House. And helping elect leaders likeSherrod Brown and Vice President Harris is an important part of that.

I briefed President Trump on America’s mostclassified matters of national security while Director of CIA. And I stoodeye-to-eye with the most dangerous dictators in the world as Trump’s Secretaryof State. It takes a lot to make me feel on edge. So the fact that I’m evensending you this email should give you pause. Because I’m afraid we have aproblem. A big one. I just got word that Kamala Harris and the Democrats arecloser than they’ve ever been before to destroying our Conservative HouseMajority once and for all. The latest reports show they’ve stockpiled over$100,000,000 to defeat us in enough swing states to bring forth a COMPLETELIBERAL TAKEOVER. The ONLY THING standing in the way of Kamala Harris havingfull control – and ramming through any radical policy she wants – is just afew competitive House seats. That’s it. I don’t tell you this lightly and Iknow that’s not what you want to see happen to our country. That’s why I’mrushing to you, in partnership with Majority Leader Steve Scalise, to raise agame-changing one million dollars in the next 72 hours. I know what you’rethinking… that’s not enough runway to raise that much. But desperate timescall for desperate measures. And if that’s what it’ll take to win, I’m willingto chase down every lead. If all you can spare is ten or twenty bucks, thatwould be incredible. If you can afford more that’s even better. I only askthat everyone give something. Will you do what it takes to hand Kamala Harrisand the Democrats a humiliating defeat? YES: I’LL PITCH IN TEN BUCKS YES:I’LL PITCH IN TWENTY BUCKS YES: I’LL PITCH IN FIFTY BUCKS I’LL PITCH INANOTHER AMOUNT I know this is a lofty goal. I know there’s not much time tohit it. It would be much easier to call it a day and not even try. But justgiving up plays right into their hands. That’s why I’m taking the time to sendyou this email. Our path to success fully relies on EVERYONE pitching inSOMETHING. That’s how we’ll catch up to the Democrats and win this election ina landslide. Frankly, that’s the only way. So I really hope you can step upwhen we need you the most. Thank you. God bless you. Mike Pompeo This isSteve Scalise. As your Majority Leader, I’m respectfully asking you to fillout my ELECTION YEAR CHECK-IN at your earliest convenience. It’s important.

Dark money donors have already poured $25million into Nevada to flip it red, and there’s zero question that Trump’svisit today will spark a fresh wave of GOP spending in this battleground. I’mgoing to need a groundswell of grassroots resources to fight back againstTrump, Sam Brown, and their dark money allies – which is why I’m counting onyou to take full advantage of this opportunity to have your donation go TWICEas far toward keeping Nevada blue.

Now, Peter, we must take the energy and optimism from this week and execute our plan to win on November 5th. This election is the ultimate existential fight to protect our freedoms, our democratic institutions, and the rule of law. From the freedom to vote to the freedom to choose to the freedom to love who we want, we cannot and will not let the MAGA Republican party take away the hard-won rights we’ve secured. We’re not going back. This November, only one presidential candidate has a vision for our future: Vice President Kamala Harris will support working families, restore our freedoms, and expand access to the American Dream so that everyone has the opportunity to thrive. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has no real policies or plans to help the American people. Instead, his plans are to cut taxes for the ultra-wealthy and corporations and hoard power for himself and his extremist allies. The choice is clear this November: Vice President Harris and Coach Walz, and all of the progress we can achieve when we come together, or the extremist Trump-Vance ticket and their radical agenda to drag our country backward.

The Democratic National Convention is wrapping up tonight, which means election season is heating up. We’re so close to nominating Kamala Harris and Tim Walz to be our next president and vice president, and I have no doubt that their ticket will lead us to victory in November. Friend: I’m doing everything I can to hand them a strong Senate majority to govern with and build a future Americans can be proud of. But I can't do it alone. That's why I'm reaching out today to ask you to split $5 between Kirsten Gillibrand and Debbie’s campaigns to help defend our Senate majority: https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_dmp?refcode=jtk5311-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Debbie is a proud Floridian running to defeat Rick Scott in Florida — and unlike her opponent, I know that Debbie will always fight to protect our personal freedoms and our democracy. In fact, that's why Debbie couldn't attend the DNC this week — she was focusing on her grassroots work in her home state, and gearing up for the Florida primary, which she has now won. Look: It's clear Debbie is committed to serving those in her community, and that's why I'm proud to stand with Debbie in the fight to retire Trump's ally. With the polls showing Debbie and Rick Scott locked in a statistical tie, it's crucial for us to show the GOP that Debbie has a strong group of Democrats standing behind her. Like you, Debbie and I are excited about the momentum we’re seeing from Democrats across the nation — and that's why I'm personally asking you to help us build on that and get Debbie the resources she needs to pull ahead in the polls. So please: Will you help Debbie reach her $3 million goal before midnight? Every dollar brings us closer to flipping Florida blue and defending our Senate majority — and democracy — from Republican extremists. https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_dmp?refcode=jtk5311-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you, Chuck Schumer -------- This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

At the time, I was serving as the senior ethicsofficial at the National Security Council in the White House. After Alexreported the call to me, my brother and I made the fateful decision to do ourpatriotic duty and stand up to Donald Trump at the risk of our decades-longmilitary careers. We blew the whistle on him and reported his corrupt phonecall with Ukraine up the chain of command. Our actions eventually led to hisimpeachment, and Trump retaliated by firing us from our posts. The decision toblow the whistle on Donald Trump cost my brother and me our military careers.But over two decades ago, I swore an oath to protect our country and ourConstitution from threats, foreign and domestic, and I would not let Trumpdeter me from that duty. So I decided to run for Congress in Virginia to fightback against Trump and the far-right Republicans who enable his abuse of powerand attacks on our Democracy. But this race is one of the most competitive inthe country, and my MAGA opponent has the backing of Trump and his millions ofdollars. It’s not going to be easy to win.

255,Chrissy,info@chrissyhoulahanforcongress.com,Hello again from Chicago!,2024-08-21T23:01:07Z,2024,8,21,23,1,chrissyhoulahanforcongress.com,"Derek, it's Chrissy again on day three of the convention. One thing that’ssurprised me about this week – this my first convention – is that it’s not allcolorful hats and exciting speeches, there’s a lot of programming focused onsolutions to our nation’s problems. For example, yesterday, after breakfastwith my friend, Senator Chris Coons, and delegates from Delaware, Iparticipated in a discussion about veterans health care. Given that policymakers and stakeholders from all over the country are gathered in one place,that makes sense to me now. :-) Most of the media outlets reporting from theconvention are set up at the United Center on “media row.” After attending areception hosted by Elect Democratic Women – I’m on the board – I went to theUnited Center to talk with Julie Mason with SiriusXM’s nonpartisan POTUSchannel about the important role Pennsylvania plays in electing Kamala Harrisand Tim Walz as our next President and Vice President. I think my strongestmemory from yesterday was being able to see all the state banners that I’vealways seen on television as a child and feeling the energy of the arena. Andhaving the chance to walk through media row and seeing the free press inaction, all the conversations that were being had in and around thisincredibly energized convention. It’s a privilege to be here and a hugeresponsibility. There is so, so much excitement and joy for Kamala Harris andTim Walz and at the end of this week, we have to go back to our communitiesand phone bank, knock on doors, talk to our neighbors, and do the criticalwork of electing this ticket. So I’m counting on you to help me do just that.To power my reelection campaign – to elect Democrats up and down the ballotacross Pennsylvania – we need to raise $2,500 by the end of the convention atmidnight tomorrow. Are you with me? If you’re able, please donate $5 or moreright now to help us reach voters in PA to keep this seat blue, take back theHouse, and get me back to work on the issues that matter to your family.https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/houlahan-digital?refcode=jtk1044-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you for yourhelp.

So I’m asking you one more time if you’ll chip in tohelp Democrats cut through the noise and connect with voters.

PolitiFact rated Slotkin’s claims regarding Mike’srecord on China asFALSE. Slotkin’s lies were so egregious that reputable mediaoutlets rightfully cast them aside, but Slotkin and her allies continue tomislead Michigan voters as they try and cover for her non-disclosure agreementthat helped a Chinese corporation secure Michigan taxpayer money. Slotkin’srecord of lies is long and noted. Just last week, Slotkin was caughtinappropriately claiming a tax credit meant for farmers so she could avoidpaying $2,700 in property taxes that fund Michigan public schools. Earlierthis year,Slotkin’s false claim that she was a small business owner wasexposed as a lie and she’s responsible for an entity in violation of Michiganstate law. The fact is Mike Rogers has long been one of the strongestopponents of Chinese efforts to infiltrate our economy, undermine our nationalsecurity, and attempts to dislodge the U.S. on the world stage. Mike led theinvestigation that warned the American people about Huawei and ZTE, and helpedsmall, medium, and large businesses combat Chinese espionage efforts. “Thefacts are clear: Mike Rogers has spent his career fighting China andprotecting Michigan families, while Slotkin sold out Michiganders and helped aChinese corporation take our jobs, our farm land, and our taxpayer dollars.Slotkin will only serve herself, but Mike will continue to have the backs ofMichiganders.” — Rogers for Senate Communications Director Chris GustafsonRead more about Slotkin’s shameful disinformation campaign below and atPolitiFact . Claim that Senate candidate Mike Rogers worked to give Chinesecompanies U.S. access lacks evidence PolitiFact August 23, 2024 Rogers workedfor American tech companies that had connections to Huawei — including AT&T;and Nokia. But Slotkin’s ad would have viewers believe Rogers was involved indeals to bring Chinese tech to the U.S. There’s little evidence to back thatup. ""At no point ever has Mike advocated for Chinese technology companies,especially Huawei and ZTE,"" Rogers campaign spokesperson Chris Gustafson said.… As House Intelligence Committee chair, Rogers oversaw an investigation thatled to the committee labeling Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese tech company, asnational security threats. … Rogers’ campaign and AT&T; told us that Rogerswas not involved in any business decisions related to Huawei. Gustafson saidRogers ""played absolutely zero role and had no oversight or say in equipmentprocurement for AT&T; Wireless."" AT&T; confirmed Rogers’ position in an email,and said he ""had no role in business or purchasing decisions with thecompany."" … Our ruling In an ad, Slotkin’s campaign said Rogers was ""helpingChinese companies get access to the U.S."" Rogers worked for AT&T; while it waspursuing deals with Chinese phone companies to sell their devices in the U.S.But Rogers’ role was separate from those business decisions, the company said,and there’s no evidence he was involved.

Project 2025 lays out Donald Trump’s dangerous plan should he win the presidency. He wants to rip away reproductive freedom nationwide, end civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ Americans, fire government employees who put loyalty to their country before Donald Trump, terminate the Affordable Care Act, increase everyday costs for working families, and more. If Donald Trump gets his way, he would fundamentally change the way our government works, impacting our national security, our economy, our freedoms, and our future. From my time serving in the Army and now to serving Colorado in Congress, I have never stopped fighting against extremism. I’m not about to stop now.

Everyone expected me to just walkaway – but I’m not someone who ever, ever gives up. I’m taking a leap of faithhere and have thrown my name on the ballot once again. The Democratsoverpowered us in this race before – and now all indicators are pointingtoward this election being a complete toss-up. My stomach is in knots – theDemocrats have already raised an astonishing $30 MILLION, and Kamala Harrisjust raised $100 million bucks(I know, I can’t believe anyone would give hermoney either…but they do). That’s why I’m humbly asking for your help: Willyou step up and chip in just a few bucks in the next hour to help us counterthis massive Left-wing onslaught? I’ll just tell you: I’m afraid to see whathappens if this email doesn’t work. The Democrats & the media hacks areterrified of me – that’s because as a young Hispanic female, I obliterateevery woke narrative they push. So, they will truly do anything to destroy me.The Democrats know that if they lose the Hispanic vote, it’s over for them.Forever. I’m opening my heart to you here: Please, please help out: CONTRIBUTEGod bless you, and God bless America.

Marsha Blackburn and the radical GOPare going to end our democracy as we know it — if we let them. Marshasupported the Big Lie of election fraud in 2020.

I know what you’re thinking.I get a lot of eye rolls when I say the word Nebraska and tell people that I’mrunning against a Republican. A lot of people don’t think we can win against atwo-term incumbent who has an (R) next to her name. But give me the chance toexplain why they’re wrong. The people of Nebraska are ready for change. FOURnew polls show me neck-and-neck with Republican Deb Fischer – and in one poll,I am even LEADING by 2 points! Seriously. Nebraskans are fed up withWashington. Both parties – Democrats and Republicans – are full of too manypeople that have been bought and paid for by corporations and billionaires.The Republicans don’t look out for blue-collar working people like me, and toomany Democrats in DC don’t seem to understand rural America anymore. I’m notrich, and I don’t come from some political dynasty. I’ve got no businessrunning for the U.S. Senate – and that’s exactly why I am. I am a proud card-carrying steamfitter and mechanic. I was president of my local union before Igot fired for leading a strike that saved 500 middle-class jobs in Nebraska. Iserved in the United States Navy and joined the National Guard to help pay forcollege before I had to drop out so I could keep food on the table for myfamily. There’s nobody like me in the Senate. But with your help, I believe wecan win and finally elect a senator whose collars are blue. And these newpolls showing me in the lead prove it. I don’t have corporate PACs writing mehundreds of thousands of dollars in checks like my opponent does. If I’m goingto defeat Republican Deb Fischer and win this Senate race, I am counting ongrassroots donors like you to believe in me and make a donation right now tomy campaign: Please, will you chip in just $10 to my campaign for U.S. Senate– or whatever amount you can afford – to help me defeat Republican Deb Fischerand win this Senate seat in November?[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20240821am-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=2814f8e8-b45f-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b&recurring;=true]Please use the links in this email to start a weekly donation through ActBlue:DONATE $10[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20240821am-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=2814f8e8-b45f-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b]DONATE $25[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20240821am-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=2814f8e8-b45f-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b]DONATE $35[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20240821am-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=2814f8e8-b45f-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b]DONATE $50[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20240821am-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=2814f8e8-b45f-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b]DONATE $100[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20240821am-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=2814f8e8-b45f-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b]Other Amount[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20240821am-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=2814f8e8-b45f-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b&recurring;=true]I believe we can protect our democracy, stop these ridiculous abortion bans,and put an end to the corruption in Washington.

287,Elizabeth Warren,info@e.elizabethwarren.com,Before my speech on Thursday night,2024-08-21T00:26:40Z,2024,8,21,0,26,e.elizabethwarren.com,"Warren for Senate: https://act.elizabethwarren.com/go/370?source=em-header&t;=1001&akid;=2316%2E4032634%2EYzk1vy Twelve years ago next month, Iheaded to Charlotte, North Carolina, to speak at my first-ever DemocraticNational Convention. While I was waiting for my rehearsal, I tried to rememberthe first time I’d watched a national convention on TV. I must have been aboutseven, sprawled on the floor with my dolls, on a tweedy rug in front of ablack-and-white television. All three channels carried whichever nationalconvention was taking place just then. To be honest, I was probably hoping ILove Lucy and Gunsmoke would come back on soon. In 2012, as I looked aroundthe giant arena, I thought about how the woman standing there would haveseemed as far away as the moon to that little girl in front of the televisionset. The next night, my heart was hammering as I stepped into the blindinglights. People started applauding. It looked like a zillion people, on theirfeet and starting to yell. That made me even more nervous. But after a fewseconds, something shifted. I stopped thinking of all the delegates and allthe others in the arena as just an anonymous crowd. I could see faces. I couldsee people wave. I felt a sudden urge to line up everyone in the audience so Icould spend a minute with each person, shake hands or hug or touch an arm, andsay, “I know how important this fight is. We’ll fight together and we’ll win.”And then I took a deep breath and started. This Thursday night, I’ll take thestage at another DNC. I’ll talk about why we need to elect Kamala Harris andTim Walz as our next president and vice president. I’ll talk about our fightto make Washington work not just for the rich and powerful but for everyone.And even though I won’t get to pull aside every attendee in the arena and allthe viewers watching at home, I’ll remember that this speech isn’t about me —it’s about each individual person who’s a part of our team. It’s about thepolicies we’re fighting for — and the people who those policies benefit. It’sabout the working parents putting dinner on the table, the little girlswatching at home sprawled on the floor with their dolls, the teachersreviewing their lesson plans who deserve a raise, the nurses checking theirstudent loan balances, and everyone who needs to know that our government ison their side. I’m running for re-election this year so I can fight alongsideKamala Harris and Tim Walz to make real change and continue passing the plansthat this team has been fighting for since 2012 and even earlier, like takingon big banks, reining in greedy corporations, bringing down costs forfamilies, and rooting corruption out of Washington. I’m also working to keepMAGA extremists out of power — because they are a threat to our democracy andour freedoms — while tackling the rotten system they’ve grown out of: a systemthat rewards the wealthy and fans the flames of hate.

It’s Lisa Blunt Rochester here. I’m honored to be speaking at the Democratic National Convention tomorrow night. I can’t wait to see Democrats from across the country come together to support my friend Kamala Harris. Through their decades of public service, Kamala and Tim Walz have shown the leadership required to be America’s next President and Vice President, and I couldn’t be more proud to support their campaign. Because there is a lot at stake in this election. In just a few months, voters will decide between two futures for America: 1. Donald Trump wants a country ruled by hatred, division, and a government working for the wealthy – not the average person. 2. Kamala Harris wants an America ruled by love, unity, and a government committed to serving all its citizens – not just the powerful. Folks, to make sure Kamala is our next President, we need to guarantee Democrats win up and down the ballot in November.

Hand sanitizer. Books, from greatnovels to science textbooks. Desk chairs. When we underfund our publicschools, our kids end up in oversized classes with overwhelmed teachers — manyof whom use their own money to pay for classroom basics. As a mom and ateacher, I’ve experienced this firsthand in Arizona schools. And when I sawhow my daughter, her classmates, and her teacher were suffering fromRepublican budget cuts, I was motivated to do more. It’s what first inspiredme to run for the Arizona State House in 2016, and why I’m now taking thatfight to Congress. I’m running because I want to build a brighter future forevery kid in Arizona. By defending reproductive freedom , we give parents thepower to start a family when they’re ready, financially and emotionally. Byinvesting in child tax credits , we help working families make ends meet, sothey can get food on the table for their kids. By supporting public schools ,we ensure every child has access to a strong education and the tools they needto succeed. By protecting the environment , we keep our air clean and ourwater secure for generations to come. Peter, I’m in a toss-up race against aRepublican who is selling Arizona’s 6th Congressional District out forconservative interests.

We are fighting for theAmerica First agenda and to elect true conservatives loyal to President Trump.Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the worst political duo in modern Americanhistory, Fellow Patriot. They have: Opened our country up to an invasion overour southern border. Made a mockery of our country with his weak foreignpolicy. Protected the vile Democrats who want to transition children and havepornography in school libraries. Destroyed the once–thriving Trump economythey were handed to begin this administration. The Senate elections are vital.We can't waste President Trump's time in office. We need to be able tocapitalize on and pass critical legislation that will secure our border,restore sanity to our schools, protect America's international interests, andrestore the thriving Trump economy. That only happens if we take back theSenate so President Trump can pass the America First agenda into law. TAKEBACK THE SENATE → It is understandable to believe that America is underattack from within. These radicals in the Democrat party don't love America;theyhate our country and want to see us fall. They are enacting policies thatwill destroy our Nation if we let them. It's time to get into the game. Thiselection cycle will be the most competitive on record, with billions ofdollars spent determining who controls the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate, andthe White House. We can't afford for you to sit on the sidelines, FellowPatriot. Marjorie Taylor Greene P.S. To undo the damage from Biden andDemocrats in Washington, we need a trifecta.

It’sgoing to take all of us to give her the boot, flip SC-01 blue, and take backthe House this November. With your support, I’m confident we can get the jobdone.

We will continue to build upon the work that has been done to move America forward — not from the top down, but from the bottom up and the middle out.

In a racethis close, against an opponent this rich, every cent you can give has a hugeimpact.

It wasn't easy for my familyto leave behind everything and everyone we knew in Ecuador in search of abetter life here in America. It wasn't easy getting up at the crack of dawn asa high schooler to go work in a donut shop and help my mom make ends meet. Itwasn't easy paying my way through school to be a first-generation collegegraduate, becoming the first South American immigrant to serve in Congress, oreven winning this primary race. I never let those challenges stop me fromfulfilling my dream — my American Dream — and finding ways to give back to thecommunities and the country that allowed me to get where I am today. And theroad to defeating Rick Scott in November won't be easy either. But based oneverything we've accomplished so far (not to mention polls showing usstatistically tied and his approval dropping with each passing day), I know wehave what it takes to win. All that being said, friend, I can't win this racealone. The finish line is now in sight, so as we enter this final sprint toElection Day, I need you in this fight alongside me now more than ever. So canI please count on you to pitch in $5, $25, or anything you can spare, to helpme win this race, defeat Rick Scott, and save our Senate majority?

The WisconsinSupreme Court made a key pro-voter ruling and reversed its previous two-year-old decision banning absentee ballot drop boxes . This current, liberal-controlled court made the change from the previous, conservative high court,which banned drop boxes in a highly politicized decision after pressure fromopponents of voting rights. Essentially, the 4-3 ruling means thatfreestanding, mailbox-like drop boxes — which Wisconsin used effectively,safely, and securely in previous elections — can again be used to collectabsentee ballots this fall. Wisconsin's elected officials are thrilled andready to comply: “ Allowing eligible voters an accessible and secure way tocast a ballot just makes sense ,” Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway said. Sheadded that “ Madison is ready to follow the law and promote democracy .” Team:This decision shows how we can win in our fight to defend access to the ballotand increase voter participation across this country.

She reminded us all that even in the face of darkness, hope remainsour greatest strength. That message of hope has resonated throughout theconvention, fueling our collective resolve to stop corporate greed and fightfor the future we want to see. Leaders like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez havedelivered fiery speeches, calling out the forces that prioritize profit overpeople and reminding us that our strength lies in our numbers, not in wealth.Together, we can overwhelm the billionaires and corporate interests that tryto silence our voices. Tonight, when Kamala Harris steps onto that stage, shewill embody that very spirit of hope and resistance. By accepting thisnomination, she’s igniting a movement that tackles the critical challenges ofour time, especially the urgent fight against the climate crisis. VicePresident Harris’s record on climate is strong. From her time as California’sAttorney General, where she took on corporate polluters like ExxonMobil, toher work as Vice President, championing the Inflation Reduction Act — the mostsignificant piece of climate legislation in U.S. history — she hasconsistently put our planet over profit. But sending Kamala Harris to theWhite House isn’t enough. We need to ensure she has a strong team of climatechampions with her. That means electing a pro-climate majority in the Houseand Senate, building a strong bench of climate advocates in statelegislatures, and empowering leaders in city councils across the country.There’s strength in numbers, and if we want to see real progress, we need aunited front at every level of government.

That's why they've named him a toptarget for defeat and why their dark money super PACS are making record-breaking investments to defeat him. This race is going to go down to the wire.Right now, Sherrod's wealthy opponent is pouring millions of dollars of hisown money to flip his seat – and I'm concerned their spending spree could beworking against my friend Sherrod Brown. The GOP might outspend Sherrod in hisrace, but they will not outwork his team – especially if we send a surge ofsupport today to help him keep building momentum. Here's why we need Sherrodin the Senate: He's our most powerful champion for working families, fightingday in and day out for the dignity of those who make this country work. Andhe's not afraid to take on corporations, Wall Street, and right-wingbillionaires to stop them from rigging our system to benefit the powerful andthe privileged. And Sherrod is always one of the first to show up and fightfor our progressive values when reproductive freedom, affordable health care,our democracy, and more are on the line. I know we can fight back and winbecause Sherrod has shown over and over that he knows how to win in a redstate, but I'm counting on people like you to split just $5 between ourcampaigns to help Sherrod win in Ohio and save the Democratic Senate Majority.[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/merkleybrown2024?refcode=2024-08-21-brown&recurring;=&amount;=5&amounts;=10,30,50,100,200&refcode2;=b1f3f18b-d75f-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b]Donate Now[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/merkleybrown2024?refcode=2024-08-21-brown&recurring;=&amount;=5&amounts;=10,30,50,100,200&refcode2;=b1f3f18b-d75f-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b]Onward!

But the fight didn’t end there.Instead, my brothers and I found that we had a whole other fight ahead of us:The fight to get the care we were promised. The care we earned. But I neverlost hope. I took on the work myself. I figured out how I could get my guysrecognition, their services, their disability payments. I went to Congress tochange the system, to make sure it lived up to the promises we make to thepeople who serve, and to their families. I slept by a burn pit while I was inIraq, and countless others did the same. Guys I deployed with, healthy, strongguys, came down with serious illnesses because of those burn pits. After along, tough fight, we passed the PACT Act to provide benefits for veteranswith those toxic exposures. And now, more than a million veterans frommultiple generations are finally getting the help they need. Trump had fouryears to get that bill done, and he didn’t. He dodged the draft himself andmade some other guy take his place. He called fallen Marines from World War Iburied in France “suckers” and “losers.” Just last week, he insulted the fewwho earned our nation's most sacred military honor, the Medal of Honor. He andKari Lake want you to believe our military and our veterans have no greaterchampion. But they don’t care about us. Theirs is the same record that landedmy guys back home needing to scrape and claw for PTSD treatment, for healthcare, for basic dignity. They have no place leading this nation, and after allthe progress we have made together over the last few years, it is on us to doeverything we can to defeat them. That’s what I told the audience at theDemocratic National Convention, and that is why I am running for U.S. Senatein Arizona. But I can’t do it alone. In everything I’ve accomplished in life,I’ve always had a team behind me. You are a critical part of that team, Peter.And today, I need your help.

My former party came after me for the high crime of standing up toHillary Clinton at the height of her power in 2016. A lot has changed sincethen – for starters, I’m no longer a Democrat. Like so many, the DemocratParty left me behind and became the Party of corporate elitists, warmongers,and anti-freedom propagandists.(In fact, I literally wrote the book aboutdoing what’s RIGHT for our country and LEAVING the Democrat Party!)

We need to raise 100K dollars by tonight so we canbegin to put our plan into action. We’re short of that goal by about 7%. So –with a humble heart, a spine of steel, and love of our great country – Irespectfully ask you for a small contribution of 10 or 25 dollars. Will youstand with me? YES >> _NO >> We set this ambitious goal because this is ano-fail mission – we must defeat the Democrat elite at the ballot box and senda powerful message that we, the people will not allow those who are destroyingour freedom to remain in power. Your contribution to our cause of freedomwould make a tremendous difference. So I’m asking you: Can you please help us?God bless you. God bless America. – Tulsi It's House Majority Leader SteveScalise. I’m respectfully asking you to fill out my ELECTION YEAR CHECK-IN atyour earliest convenience. It’s important.

While communities like mine all across our state were strippedfor parts, corrupt politicians like Josh Hawley have attacked workers withanti-union schemes like “Right-to-Work” and fought to block wage increases forMissouri families — all to enrich multinational corporations and mega-donorswho bankroll their campaigns and their careers. They helped Wall Streetfinanciers sell off our farmland to billionaires in China and Brazil —devastating rural communities and contributing to the closure of 90% ofMissouri hog producers in a single generation. One of Missouri’s oldest andlargest employers, Anheuser-Busch, was sold to a Belgian conglomerate —costing Missouri more than a thousand jobs. Missouri-based Monsanto, one ofthe world’s most important agrochemical and biotechnology companies, was soldto Germany — eliminating even more jobs. And as dozens more headquarters havebeen taken out of state, politicians in power like Josh Hawley were happy tosit back and watch it happen. Manufacturing, agriculture, production — they’reshipping it all away to foreign oligarchs who don’t care about working peoplein our state. And while our communities were getting gutted, these samepoliticians voted time and time again to spend trillions of dollars andthousands of lives on overseas wars that got their Big Oil friends rich. Atthe same time, these politicians have spent decades sparking phony culturewars to distract and divide our families. They’ve become so obsessed withcontrolling our lives, they even made Missouri the first state in the nationto ban abortion. Our state deserves a Senator who will stand up and fight forit, not run for the exit like Josh Hawley — and I’m ready to serve.

It’s worth it.Trust me. – Steve Scalise *** Original Message From Tulsi Gabbard *** I tookon the Clinton Machine. And I paid the price for it. Aloha – this is FORMERDemocrat Tulsi Gabbard. My former party came after me for the high crime ofstanding up to Hillary Clinton at the height of her power in 2016. A lot haschanged since then – for starters, I’m no longer a Democrat. Like so many, theDemocrat Party left me behind and became the Party of corporate elitists,warmongers, and anti-freedom propagandists.(In fact, I literally wrote thebook about doing what’s RIGHT for our country and LEAVING the Democrat Party!)The rot is too deep – it can’t be fixed, it must be driven out entirely.That’s why I’m sending you this email. I have a plan to bring down the ENTIREcabal of Elites running the Democrat Party. We need to raise 100K dollars bytonight so we can begin to put our plan into action. We’re short of that goalby about 7%. So – with a humble heart, a spine of steel, and love of our greatcountry – I respectfully ask you for a small contribution of 10 or 25 dollars.Will you stand with me? YES >> _NO >> We set this ambitious goal becausethis is a no-fail mission – we must defeat the Democrat elite at the ballotbox and send a powerful message that we, the people will not allow those whoare destroying our freedom to remain in power. Your contribution to our causeof freedom would make a tremendous difference. So I’m asking you: Can youplease help us? God bless you.

Back then, Democrats and Republicans could disagree without being disagreeable. But that has changed, thanks in large part to Donald Trump, who insults and attacks anyone who disagrees with him. I’ve worked with plenty of Republican members of Congress to make meaningful progress on important issues like mass transit, national security, open space, nuclear nonproliferation, freedom of the press, and more. But these days, far too many of my colleagues in the GOP are siding with Donald Trump and unwilling to work for the greater good of our country and our democracy. They stand strongly alongside Trump, even when he breaks the law, or incites a violent attack against the Capitol — or, with the help of a partisan Supreme Court, aspires to place himself above the law.

At the DNC I delivered our campaign’s message to the whole nation — and stood firmly with our next President, Kamala Harris. Here’s what I said. My family’s story is America’s story. My father immigrated from Italy, went to college, was a navigator on a B-24 during World War II, came home, and was elected as the youngest judge in New York history at 28. What a country! It’s painful to me that immigration has become so polarizing. The border is broken, and this year we had a bipartisan border deal. But that deal was blocked by far right extremists! Now, we have to come together to celebrate a candidate who knows America is worth it. Who knows this nation, built by immigrants, is a rare and beautiful thing, and who joyfully accepts the challenge to secure our border, to treat people like human beings, and to move our country forward. That’s Kamala Harris! But team, we need to make sure that Kamala Harris has a partner in Congress, and that means flipping the House! NY-03 is a must-win seat, and I’ll need your help to keep it.   So team – can you split a donation between me and Blue Amp right now to keepme in Congress and ensure Kamala Harris has a partner to pass her agenda? --- | --- | | | | | | DONATE NOW >> --- | We have a lot of work to do, and I need you by my side.

Right now, my opponent is sending Marylanderspetty–and false–political attacks against me, and I will cut to the chase: Ineed your help to fight back. My opponent is using every tired negativepartisan attack in the book. She’s even going so far as to say I would be “arubber stamp for the MAGA agenda” in a campaign fundraising text. You know me,so you know that’s an outright lie. In the Senate, I’ll be the critical swingvote to stand up to extremism, bring people together, and get the country backto decency and common sense. I will not bow down to one person or one party.This is a perfect example of politicians playing toxic political games only todivide us, andthis is exactly why we need to fix the mess in Washington. Ispent eight years as governor working across the aisle to deliver bipartisancommon-sense solutions to the issues that matter to Marylanders – making lifemore affordable, improving public safety and supporting first responders, andI intend to bring the same type of leadership to Washington. But with myopponent spending millions to spread this messaging to more Marylanders, Ineed your support to push back. Will you chip in a donation to support mycampaign? CHIP IN The truth is, I am only in this race to fight for a betterfuture for ALL Marylanders andALL Americans. I’m not running to serve oneparty. I’m running to fight for Maryland and fix the broken politics–just likeI did as governor. But with the attacks mounting, I need your support morethan ever. Will you consider chipping in a donation to help my campaign staycompetitive? CHIP IN It’s not in my nature to sit back and watch thedysfunction continue without doing what I can to roll up my sleeves and workto solve the biggest issues we face. For eight years, we showed how to getstuff done without getting sucked into petty partisan games. Now, it’s time tobring this common sense approach to Washington with your help. Thank you foryour support. I look forward to getting the opportunity to meet with you onthe campaign trail! Thank you, Gov. Hogan P.S. My opponent is right about onething: this race is a toss-up. And that means it will be the most expensiverace I’ve ever run. The national Party machine has lined up tens of millionsto attack me, spread lies, and I need your help to push back to tell thetruth.Your donation of $100, $50, or even $25 goes a long way to helping usclose the fundraising gap. Thanks for your time and support. - LH CHIP IN APersonal Message from Governor Larry Hogan: Hi, it’s Governor Larry Hogan.When I launched my campaign for the U.S. Senate, I did so with a deep resolveto maintain the leadership style and principles that guided me during my eightyears as governor. Fifty years ago, my father, Maryland Congressman LarryHogan Sr. made a tough decision. He became the first Republican to come outfor the impeachment of President Nixon. He put aside party politics and hisown personal considerations and stepped up to do the right thing for Marylandand the nation. Today, Washington is completely broken because that kind ofleadership and willingness to put country over party has become far too rare.But it’s not in my nature to sit back and watch the dysfunction continuewithout doing what I can to roll up my sleeves and get to work. I’m under noillusion this will be an easy road. But I’m no stranger to uphill battles, andI know I can’t do it without your support. I don't aspire to be a UnitedStates senator. I don’t need a title and I don’t need a job, but I’m moreconcerned than ever about the direction of the country and I have become moreconvinced that I can make a difference by taking the approach and style ofleadership I had during my eight years as governor to Washington. It’s nosurprise this mindset has made me a target of the Washington partisans.Despite early polls showing a lead, I know I’m the underdog in this race. Andthat’s why your support TODAY is so crucial. So if you can chip in a donationof $25 or more, it will go a long way in helping me continue building a strongcampaign. For eight years, we proved that the toxic politics that divide ournation didn’t need to divide our state, and we got results! Let’s get back towork again and send a message to Washington that will be heard loud and clearacross the country! Will you join me today and help end the dysfunction inWashington?

Mitch McConnell has handpicked a candidate to run against Jon Tester. Tim Sheehy is nothing but a wannabe cowboy who lies almost as much as he breathes. He’s a snake, and we can’t trust him. Jon Tester is a third-generation dirt farmer with a proven track record of winning tough fights and trust me, he’ll do anything to deliver results for the folks back home. But here’s what’s got me ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED: McConnell is slinging mud to the tune of $65 MILLION. His slimy attacks against Jon are working, and now, the polls are tightening. This race is wayyyyy too close for comfort! The Senate majority will come down to Montana, so I need you to GET OFF YOUR YOU-KNOW-WHAT and help keep Jon Tester in the Senate. Jon told me that his next fundraising deadline is hours away, but he’s falling behind. WTF? He NEEDS a surge in grassroots donations RIGHT NOW to keep up with Mitch McConnell and his lame opponent. I’m calling on 28 more folks in Toledo: Friend, will you URGENTLY split $10 between Jon Tester's campaign and Kirsten Gillibrand's to help Jon Tester defy the odds and win the most important race on the map?

And on that front, the choice couldn’t be more clear. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz represent a new way forward. Forward on women’s reproductive rights, worker rights, and voting rights. And forward on affordable housing, access to health care, and so much more. We’ve got to stand together, organize together, pray together, and work together to heal the land and elect Kamala Harris.

At the DNC I delivered our campaign’s message to the whole nation— andstood firmly with our next President, Kamala Harris. Here’s what I said. Myfamily’s story is America’s story. My father immigrated from Italy, went tocollege, was a navigator on a B-24 during World War II, came home, and waselected as the youngest judge in New York history at 28. What a country! It’spainful to me that immigration has become so polarizing. The border is broken,and this year we had a bipartisan border deal. But that deal was blocked byfar right extremists! Now, we have to come together to celebrate a candidatewho knows America is worth it. Who knows this nation, built by immigrants, isa rare and beautiful thing, and who joyfully accepts the challenge to secureour border, to treat people like human beings, and to move our countryforward. That’s Kamala Harris! But Peter, we need to make sure that KamalaHarris has a partner in Congress, and that means flipping the House! NY-03 isa must-win seat, and I’ll need your help to keep it.

I couldn't have gotten this far without supporters like you, and as we enter the final lap of the race, your continued support is the only way I'll win: Especially when recent polls show this race statistically tied. Even though CNN calls Rick Scott one of the most vulnerable senators on the map, his campaign still has hundreds of millions of dollars of his personal fortune at its disposal to fuel the most bizarre and dishonest attack ads possible about me. I need my message to beat his to the chase, and I can't do that without you.

Friend, Yet another poll is out on the New Mexico Senate race that shows us closing in on Martin Heinrich. Here’s what the latest poll shows: * We’re only six points down * Heinrich polling his lowest ever at only 40% * 21% of voters are undecided! Remember, this is a seat that the mainstream media is telling us was supposed to be safe blue, and the Democrats NEVER thought would be in danger. It is telling that a career politician like Heinrich—who has been in the Senate for over a decade—has 60% of voters in his “safe blue” state not ready or willing to vote for him! This is a clear sign that voters in New Mexico are fed up with the radical and destructive agenda he and the Biden-Harris regime have been pushing on us. It’s no wonder we outraised Heinrich last quarter and continue to close in on him! We have put New Mexico in play, friend—something the Left never saw coming. But closing the deal will require maintaining our momentum. The Democrats have a big surprise coming—IF you can continue to support us in this fight. We’re looking for 120 supporters to chip in within the next 36 hours to ensure we can keep the pressure on Heinrich and continue closing the gap. Can you spare a few bucks? CHIP IN NOW! Thank you again for your support! For New Mexico, Nella Domenici Republican for Senate ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici’s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella’s family’s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world’s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

Wade , they ripped abortion access from millions of women across the country and endangered lives in the process. For the first time in history, the Supreme Court revoked a constitutional right — and since, the floodgates have been opened to extreme and regressive abortion restrictions nationwide. Only a few weeks ago, Iowa became the 22nd state to pass a total or near-total abortion ban. One third of women are now unable to exercise what was a constitutional right only 3 years ago. But these draconian attempts to roll back our rights don’t stop at the state level. Donald Trump’s second term agenda, Project 2025, is designed to control women even further — vowing to take the commonly-used abortion pill mifepristone off the market and allow employers to deny their employees coverage for critical reproductive health care like birth control. What’s worse: New York’s own House Republicans are complicit. By endorsing the extreme Trump-Vance ticket, they’re supporting Project 2025. We can’t let MAGA Republicans succeed in rolling back our rights. That’s why I’m fighting to secure more funding for abortion clinics in New York and nationwide, and just introduced the Affordability is Access Act to defend access to affordable over-the-counter birth control. If we’re going to safeguard access to reproductive care once and for all, we have to flip the House blue and keep MAGA extremists out of office.

As mayor,I made it my priority to fight for more hospital beds, more tests, and to makemasks more accessible. During that first treacherous year, we needed nationalleadership, but instead, we got Trump. He downplayed the virus and peddledconspiracy theories, and as a result, we lost hundreds of thousands ofAmericans — including my mom, a healthcare worker, and my stepfather. So whenDonald Trump and his MAGA extremist cronies downplay the horror of thepandemic, it makes me furious. But Americans spoke up and elected Joe Bidenand Kamala Harris to give us the leadership and change we needed. They got thevirus under control. They got folks vaccinated. And they passed the historicAmerican Rescue Plan. I am a proud immigrant. I came to the United States as ayoung child, grew up poor, and like many immigrant families, struggled to getby. But my mom brought me here because she believed in the American Dream. Andwhen I raised my right hand and became a citizen of our beautiful country, itwas the proudest day of my life. But if it were up to Trump, someone like mewould never be serving our country. On the other hand, it's people like KamalaHarris who inspire the American Dream my mother and I were able to achieve.And that’s the kind of leader we need as our next President—one who inspireshope, resilience, and progress. But she can’t do it alone. So please,contribute to my re-election campaign today to help Democrats take back theHouse majority. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz need a Democratic House and Senateto help them defend our democracy from MAGA extremism.[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/rg-em-dnc-video?refcode2=b0de20c6-1860-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b] Never did it cross mymind that the young boy who immigrated here with little to nothing would notonly be serving in Congress, but speaking at the Democratic NationalConvention. I am eternally grateful for the opportunity this country has givenme, and when we elect Kamala Harris as our first Black woman president, I knowmany other young people will see that they too, can achieve their Americandream.

409,Jane Fonda,info@janepac.com,Hope is a muscle.,2024-08-23T17:50:18Z,2024,8,23,17,50,janepac.com,"When I think about everything we’re up against in the climate fight — from therelentless grip the fossil fuel industry has on our political system torapidly escalating climate disasters and the GOP’s dystopian Project 2025agenda — it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. But there’s something that alwayskeeps me moving forward. It’s hope. (I think a lot of us were feeling a bitmore of that feeling this week, right?) I always say: Hope is like a muscle.The more we use it, the stronger it gets. But it doesn’t grow on its own. Wehave to keep working at it, especially when the challenges seeminsurmountable. The thing about hope is that it’s not passive. It’s notsitting around, waiting for something good to happen. No, hope is active. Hopeis getting up every day, even when the odds are stacked against us, andsaying, “I’m not giving up.” Hope is voting in every election, even when notevery election goes our way. It’s showing up at protests, town halls, andcommunity meetings, even when it feels like no one is listening. It’scontinuing to organize, educate, and advocate for bold climate policies, evenwhen progress is slow. Every time you knock on a door, make a phone call, orcast your ballot, you’re building that muscle. Folks, the fossil fuel industryis betting on our despair. They’re hoping we’ll get tired, that we’ll give up.But they're underestimating us. I can’t afford to let despair win when mygrandchildren’s futures are on the line. We’re not just fighting for ourselves— we’re fighting for the world our kids and grandkids will inherit. When Ileave this place, I want my grandkids to know that I did everything in mypower to create a livable future for them. I have no choice but to choosehope. And our hope isn’t in vain; it’s fueled by the victories we’ve alreadyachieved together and the belief that we can achieve even more. Your supportthrough JanePAC alone has made a real difference. Together, we’ve helped forceBig Oil to drop a dangerous referendum in California. We’ve also endorsed morethan 65 candidates across the nation this year, from the House to localoffices, who are committed to environmental justice. In key races around thecountry, we’re paving the way for a shift in power, like in Arizona, where all11 of our endorsed candidates won their state legislature primaries. WatchingKamala Harris accept the Democratic nomination this week filled me with hope.The energy from young people and climate voters around her candidacy ispalpable. But to truly seize this moment, we need to stay engaged and keeppushing forward. So today, I’m asking you to join me in building that muscle.Let’s keep this movement strong by supporting the leaders who are fighting forour future. If you’re ready to help me keep hope alive in the climate fight,chip in any amount to fuel our mission and elect climate champions in Novemberand beyond.

In fact, when I first won my race to become Prince George’s County Executive, one of the first calls I received was from her. I’d like to share one piece of advice that she shared with me: More important than being first at something is to make sure you are not the last . And now that we’re standing on the precipice of electing our country’s first woman president, that advice feels more appropriate than ever. This whole election cycle boils down to this, friend: Will our country be dragged backward, reverting to an era of fear, overreach, and fewer rights? Or will we come together, and build a winning, vibrant coalition of supporters who recognize that we’re stronger, and better, when we come together as a country and embrace progress? That’s why we need to win BOTH the White House and the Senate in November, but it’s going to take the biggest, broadest grassroots movement our state has ever seen, so we’re going to need a lot of resources. Which is why I’m asking: Can you pitch in a split donation of $25 between my campaign and Lisa Blunt Rochester's to keep Maryland blue and help propel our country forward?

He is a patriot of the highest order. A true leader. He will go down as one of the great American presidents — and he has made us proud. President Biden believes in a future of hope and possibility. He is a man of integrity. He is the leader we needed to safeguard our democracy from an authoritarian’s threat. And after reaching the pinnacle of power, he stepped aside to pave the way for a new generation and give Democrats our best chance at defeating Donald Trump again. He is everything Donald Trump could never be. We are so grateful for Joe Biden’s leadership. We are grateful, too, that he has never given up — including here in North Carolina.

And she does not suffer fools gladly.I couldn’t be more excited to support her on the campaign trail and hear moreabout her vision for the country. We also got to hear from a slew ofDemocratic leaders who laid out our vision for our future – a vision centeredaround freedom. Freedom for a woman’s right to choose, freedom to actuallyhave the kind of books you want to read available for our kids in school,freedom in this country that allows us to stand up against oppression.Frankly, I could go on and on about how optimistic the DNC made me feel.

Trump will be in Howell, Michigan today for his second visit sinceformally accepting the Republican nomination and naming J.D. Vance as hisrunning mate – and his 7th time since kicking off his 2024 campaign. Howellalso happens to be in my current Congressional district, and I’ll explain whythat’s important in a moment. But first, I am asking for a contribution — $20or whatever you can afford — before Donald Trump gets here today. If that'sall you need to hear, please use this link to split a donation to Tim Kaineand my campaign today: [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tk-2024-slotkin][https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tk-2024-slotkin]secure.actblue/slotkin-2024x19[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tk-2024-slotkin] Howell, Michigan is ahistorically conservative town I won by *13 votes* in 2022. It's in LivingstonCounty, a county that Trump won with 60% of the vote against Joe Biden lasttime around. If you’ve followed any of our three campaigns, you've heard mesay that a key objective for us is to ""lose better."" That means doing just alittle bit better in the Republican-leaning areas of Michigan. Howell, theplace Trump is visiting, was at the heart of that strategy in my lastelection. So it is no surprise that Trump and likely Mike Rogers will bethere. Because they know what I know: if I can ""lose better"" in places likeLivingston, County -- we are going to win this Senate race, and we are likelyto help Kamala Harris win as well. That’s what we have to do, but I cannot doit alone. It would be a huge boon to our campaign if you would chip in andshow your support before Trump gets here. Our goal is to send a message thatwe are NOT letting them win back Michigan! Even a single $10 or $20contribution to Tim Kaine and my campaign goes a long way when lots of folksare chipping in.

And now, I am asking you to make a split donation to Upset the Setupand my campaign — to defeat Trump and Kari Lake in Arizona and defend all theprogress we have made together. Please, if you can afford it, chip in by usingthis link. [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/uts_email_2024_gallego?amount=3]My unit was the hardest-hit Marine battalion of the entire war. But the fightdidn’t end there. Instead, my brothers and I found that we had a whole otherfight ahead of us: The fight to get the care we were promised. The care weearned. But I never lost hope. I took on the work myself. I figured out how Icould get my guys recognition, their services, their disability payments. Iwent to Congress to change the system, to make sure it lived up to thepromises we make to the people who serve, and to their families. I slept by aburn pit while I was in Iraq, and countless others did the same. Guys Ideployed with, healthy, strong guys, came down with serious illnesses becauseof those burn pits. After a long, tough fight, we passed the PACT Act toprovide benefits for veterans with those toxic exposures. And now, more than amillion veterans from multiple generations are finally getting the help theyneed. Trump had four years to get that bill done, and he didn’t. He dodged thedraft himself and made some other guy take his place. He called fallen Marinesfrom World War I buried in France “suckers” and “losers.” Just last week, heinsulted the few who earned our nation's most sacred military honor, the Medalof Honor. He and Kari Lake want you to believe our military and our veteranshave no greater champion. But they don’t care about us. Theirs is the samerecord that landed my guys back home needing to scrape and claw for PTSDtreatment, for health care, for basic dignity. They have no place leading thisnation, and after all the progress we have made together over the last fewyears, it is on us to do everything we can to defeat them. That’s what I toldthe audience at the Democratic National Convention, and that is why I amrunning for U.S. Senate in Arizona. But I can’t do it alone. In everythingI’ve accomplished in life, I’ve always had a team behind me. You are acritical part of that team, friend. And today, I need your help. Please, split$3 to my campaign and Upset the Setup.

Let me pull back the curtainand explain: Pennsylvania is the closest swing state in the country. In 2016,Trump won our state by just one percentage point—and in 2020, Biden won byjust one percentage point. Derek, races in Pennsylvania aren’t easily won. Wehave to fight like hell to protect this seat, to push back against myopponent’s extremism, and to turn out the vote.

Ibrought money back to Western Pennsylvania so that we could support ourfirefighters and cops, invest in better roads, public transit, parks, andhousing, and provide clean drinking water. I’ve fought to keep corporationsfrom deceiving and ripping off the American people. I cracked down on big railto push for rail safety and protections for our communities. And I’m proud tobe fighting hard for our values every single day. Folks like my opponent onthe other side are hard at work trying to roll back abortion rights, gutvoting rights, keep health care a total ripoff, and undermine our democracy.I’m not afraid to stand up to them and fight for our freedoms.

New Mexicans can’t afford to risk another termunder Yvette Herrell — a MAGA extremist who is more concerned with pushing heranti-choice, anti-democracy and, frankly, anti-America agenda than advocatingfor the people she’s supposed to represent. This year’s election is anopportunity for Democrats to come together and expand the progress we haveworked so hard to achieve. But with less than 74 days until the polls open,extremist dark money groups are pulling out all the stops to stand in the wayof that. Holding this seat and flipping the House blue is the only way toprotect our progress — and that starts right here in NM-02 . Can you spareanything at all to fuel my fight to keep NM-02 blue and retake the Housemajority in 2024?

Kamala Harris is exactly the leader we need now, and Democrats here in North Carolina and across the country are fired up to elect her. The energy is electric. It reminds me of how we felt in 2008.

Friend -- I wish things would have gone a differentway… Democrat Vicente Gonzalez holds back Republican surge, returns 34thCongressional District to Democratic control. This is probably the hardestemail I’ve ever written. I’m Mayra Flores, the America First Hispanic womanrunning in the biggest race in the nation. After we made history and flipped ablue seat red for the first time in 100 years, the Democrats threw the kitchensink at me,and I had to concede my race. Everyone expected me to just walkaway – but I’m not someone who ever, ever gives up. I’m taking a leap of faithhere and have thrown my name on the ballot once again. The Democratsoverpowered us in this race before – and now all indicators are pointingtoward this election being a complete toss-up. My stomach is in knots – theDemocrats have already raised an astonishing $30 MILLION, and Kamala Harrisjust raised $100 million bucks(I know, I can’t believe anyone would give hermoney either…but they do). That’s why I’m humbly asking for your help: Willyou step up and chip in just a few bucks in the next hour to help us counterthis massive Left-wing onslaught? I’ll just tell you: I’m afraid to see whathappens if this email doesn’t work. The Democrats & the media hacks areterrified of me – that’s because as a young Hispanic female, I obliterateevery woke narrative they push. So, they will truly do anything to destroy me.The Democrats know that if they lose the Hispanic vote, it’s over for them.Forever. I’m opening my heart to you here: Please, please help out: CONTRIBUTEGod bless you, and God bless America.

Voters are fired up andready to vote for Democrats up and down the ballot this November. Here's wherewe stand right now: - Cook Political Report moved three critical swing states– Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia – from ""Lean Republican"" to ""Toss Up"" in theirpresidential election ratings. - Kamala Harris is leading or tied with DonaldTrump in six of the seven battleground states. - Cook Political Report alsojust moved Sen. Jacky Rosen's (NV) race from ""Toss Up"" back to ""LeanDemocrat."" Elissa Slotkin (MI-SEN) and Sen. Tammy Baldwin (WI) are alsosurging in the polls. The momentum is on our side, Peter, and Kamala Harris'sname at the top of the ticket is boosting Democratic pro-choice womennationwide. We can't slow down now.

It’s the summer of 1984. I was 22 years old, fresh out of college, and back in my small, unfurnished apartment in Madison, Wisconsin. I had a mat on the floor, a pan my aunt had given me, and a tiny, black-and-white television set. I remember sitting there alone, watching the Democratic National Convention. I was very interested in politics, but… I didn’t really know what my options were. That 1984 convention was the one where the Democrats nominated Geraldine Ferraro, the first woman to run for Vice President. So, there I was, in my little apartment, watching her take the stage and give her acceptance speech, thinking, ‘Wow, I can do anything in politics. The barriers are being broken. The sky’s the limit.' From Shirley Chisholm and Geraldine Ferraro to Hillary Clinton, these women have challenged the status quo and flipped the script on the old boys' club — and now, we all have the opportunity to make history once more. Last night, Kamala Harris officially accepted the Democratic nomination for president at the DNC, and you can bet your you-know-what that I will do everything I can to turn out Democrats across the battleground state of Wisconsin to elect her and deliver her a Democratic Senate majority by winning my own reelection race.

As I stood on stage, I felt so much pride in our party, our ticketand our progress For The People. Peter, I’m reaching out to you with arequest: If you’re proud of Democrats, excited to vote for up and down theticket and ready to flip the House, will you split a $10 gift between DCCC andthe NDRC today?

While they threaten to decimate Social Security and Medicare as weknow it, Democrats fight to protect and strengthen earned benefits. And whilethey push tax cuts for big corporations and the ultra-wealthy, Democrats standwith hardworking Americans to build an economy that works for everyone. Here’sthe bottom line: As long as Republicans hold the House majority, they’restanding in the way of our progress. Peter, are you with me? I’m asking you tosplit a gift between the DCCC and the NDRC to help ensure we keep Team Extremeout of power and help House Democrats deliver on their promises to theAmerican people.

In a race as close as this, we need all the support we can muster to defeat Martin Heinrich and take back the Senate majority. For New Mexico, Nella Domenici Republican for Senate ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici’s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella’s family’s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world’s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

Right-wing activists are sifting through voter registration lists to question their neighbors’ qualifications to vote. And now, MAGA-aligned state election board members are changing Georgia’s election rules — with less than 85 days until Election Day. Of course we’re fighting back, training new volunteers to help protect the freedom to vote and making calls and sending texts to reach voters. To continue this work at the pace that’s required, we urgently need support from grassroots donors across the country — people like you. Can you pitch in $30 to fund our programs and help ensure equal access to the ballot box? [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ff-aug24-em?amount=] The MAGA operation has become more sophisticated since trying to overturn the 2020 election, taking different approaches to tamper with our democratic process. Starting with mass voter purges through challenges enabled by SB 202, and expanding their efforts through SB 189, they’re now advancing their strategy with challenges to the election certification process and by upending election administration. We’re seeing a nationally coordinated scheme to keep ballot access as far out of reach as possible, especially for Black and brown, young, disabled, unhoused, and rural voters. They know our votes matter, which is why they’re trying so hard to silence us. Chip in today to help combat voter suppression, push back against MAGA’s strategy, and ensure access to the ballot box.

So the fact that I’m even sending you this email should giveyou pause. Because I’m afraid we have a problem. A big one.

That’s why I’m rushing to you, in partnership with Majority LeaderSteve Scalise, to raise a game-changing one million dollars in the next 72hours. I know what you’re thinking… that’s not enough runway to raise thatmuch. But desperate times call for desperate measures. And if that’s whatit’ll take to win, I’m willing to chase down every lead. If all you can spareis ten or twenty bucks, that would be incredible. If you can afford morethat’s even better. I only ask that everyone give something.

We won and saved hundreds of good-paying jobs – before Iwas fired for being the union president who led the strike. There is no onewho represents working-class people like me in the U.S. Senate.

Six years ago, I was taking omelet orders asa waitress in New York City. I didn’t have health insurance. My family wasfighting off foreclosure, and we were struggling with bills after my dadpassed away unexpectedly from cancer. Like millions of Americans, we were justlooking for an honest shake. And we were tired of cynical politics that seemedblind to the realities of working people. It was then, only through themiracles of democracy and community, that the good people of The Bronx andQueens chose someone like me to elect them in Congress. And America, in myheart, I know from that same cloth of hope and aspiration, we will also electKamala Harris and Tim Walz as President and Vice President of the UnitedStates of America. America has before us a rare and precious opportunity. InKamala Harris, we have a chance to elect a President who is for the middleclass — because she is from the middle class. She understands the urgency ofrent checks and groceries and prescriptions. She is as committed to ourreproductive and civil rights as she is to taking on corporate greed. She isworking tirelessly to secure a ceasefire in Gaza and bringing hostages home.In Kamala Harris, I see a leader who understands. I see a leader with a realcommitment to a better future for working families. We have to help her win.Because we know that Donald Trump would sell this country for a dollar if itmeant lining his own pockets and greasing the palms of his Wall Streetfriends. And I for one am tired of hearing about how a two bit union busterthinks of himself as more of a patriot than the woman who fights every singleday to lift working people out from under the boots of greed trampling on ourway of life. The truth is, Don, you cannot love this country if you only fightfor the wealthy and big business. To love this country is to fight for itspeople. All people. Working People. Everyday Americans like bartenders andfactory workers and fast food cashiers who punch a clock and are on their feetall day in some of the toughest jobs out there. You know, ever since I gotelected, Republicans have attacked me by saying that I should go back tobartending. But let me tell you, I’m happy to any day of the week, becausethere is nothing wrong with working for a living. Imagine having leaders inthe White House who understand that. Leaders like Kamala and Tim. But, justbecause the choice is clear to us, does not mean the path will be easy. Overthe next 77 days, we will have to pour every ounce, every minute, every momentinto making history on November 5th. But, we cannot send Kamala and Tim to theWhite House alone. Together, we must also elect strong Democratic majoritiesin the House and in the Senate, so that we can deliver on an ambitious agendafor the people. Because if you are a working parent trying to afford rent andchild care, Kamala is for you. If you are a senior who had to go back to workbecause your retirement didn’t stretch far enough, Kamala is for you. Ifyou’re an immigrant family just starting your American story, Kamala is foryou. America, when we knock on our neighbor’s door, organize our communities,and elect Kamala Harris to the presidency on November 5th, we will send a loudmessage that the people of this nation will not go back. We choose a new pathand open the door to a new day. One that is for the people and by the people.[ https://act.ocasiocortez.com/go/14659?c0=aoc-email-20240820-1.o9M78G&refcode;=em20240820-7041-P_FND_RES_HDL&amounts;=5%2C20%2C50%2C100%2C250%2C500%2C1000&t;=1002&akid;=7041%2E2526796%2EPRMbOU]Help us continue the fight for social, economic, environmental, and racialjustice by making a grassroots donation right now.

But now that she’s his party’s presidential nominee, he’s refusing toendorse her publicly and is skipping the DNC.

ThoughTester believes he’s being inconspicuous, his motives couldn’t be clearer:hewants to hide the policies he supports and the candidates he has hitched hiswagon to in the past because they’re wildly out of step with everydayAmericans.

Trump. I never needed political pundits orpsychologists to tell me that my Uncle Donald should never get anywhere nearthe Oval Office. I spent much of my childhood in the very house where Donaldgrew up. The cruel, weak, and deeply insecure man who brought our democracy tothe brink of disaster is the same man I have always known. The fight to defeathim and his cronies is personal for me. In 2022, I launched the DemocracyDefense Fund to build a grassroots movement to secure our electoral systemfrom Donald and the authoritarian traitors who seek to destroy it. I’m aboutto go into detail about our plans for this critical election cycle — butfirst, I have to ask, can I count on you to split $25 or more between DDF andBlue Amp Action to ensure we have the resources to defeat Donald, defend theSenate, and flip the House this November? --- | | Donate >> --- | Because of Donald’s grip on the Republican Party, it can be easy to forgetwhat an electoral disaster he’s been. Just look at the midterm results of 2018and 2022, or the 2020 election when a record 81 million people voted to ousthim. A lot of people are repulsed by him, and it’s clear why: This is the manwho sent an army of violent insurrectionists to attack the Capitol; the manwho rigged the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade; the man who will doanything to secure power and money for himself; the man I know is capable ofso much worse. Our pro-democracy movement CAN defeat him. If you split a giftof $25 or more today, you’ll be helping to fund our efforts to: 1. Flip the House. We’re supporting Congressional candidates committed to expanding voting rights and targeting Republicans who refused to certify the 2020 election. 2. Save the Senate. We’re fighting to keep a Democratic majority in the Senate, supporting those who are willing to get rid of the filibuster and approve Democrat-appointed judges — the last line of defense in protecting our right to vote. 3. Take the fight to the States. We’re investing in flippable down-ballot races that have the potential to impact the electoral certification process. 4. Advance the issues we care about. Whether it’s voting rights, health care, or common-sense gun control — we’re pushing for the policies and reforms that will build a better country. 5. Protect democracy. Hundreds of voter suppression bills have been introduced across the country in the last couple years. We’re punching back against these autocratic efforts.My uncle has the backing of billions of dollars from dark money groups to tryand sway the election his way. But Donald can’t buy what we have — an army ofpeople like you who are determined to protect our country and everything thatwe hold dear that he threatens.

At the DNC I delivered our campaign’s message tothe whole nation— and stood firmly with our next President, Kamala Harris .Here’s what I said. My family’s story is America’s story. My father immigratedfrom Italy, went to college, was a navigator on a B-24 during World War II,came home, and was elected as the youngest judge in New York history at 28.What a country! It’s painful to me that immigration has become so polarizing.The border is broken, and this year we had a bipartisan border deal. But thatdeal was blocked by far right extremists! Now, we have to come together tocelebrate a candidate who knows America is worth it. Who knows this nation,built by immigrants, is a rare and beautiful thing, and who joyfully acceptsthe challenge to secure our border, to treat people like human beings, and tomove our country forward. That’s Kamala Harris! But team, we need to make surethat Kamala Harris has a partner in Congress, and that means flipping theHouse! NY-03 is a must-win seat, and I’ll need your help to keep it.

Now (after a couple of days of much-deserved rest for our incredible field team) we're getting to work making that vision a reality. Our district has one of the lowest voter turnout rates in the entire country, Peter. Mobilizing our community is the key — not only to Yassamin's historic election to Congress this November but also to the critical races happening up and down the ballot in Arizona. Peter, we beat Donald Trump by just 0.3% in Arizona in 2020. Our open Senate seat will be pivotal in the fight to keep our razor-thin majority. We can't afford to rest on our laurels. That's why we're kicking off our general election campaign with an ambitious goal: raising $20,000 online in THREE days. Those funds will help Yassamin make history in November as the first Iranian-American Democrat in Congress, and they'll power our fieldwork to elect Democrats up and down the ballot in Arizona.

But since then, donations have slowed down drastically. Just take a look at our totals from the past week: [ https://act.tammybaldwin.com/go/3587?c0=tbe-em-aug24.wYc4IX&refcode;=AU_STB_FR_GEN_GEN_AC_20240820_PM1_V2_S1&t;=1012&akid;=3399%2E35263%2EuHPIQ2 ]A fundraising graph showing a decrease in donations over the course of the last week. Tammy’s not self-funding her campaign like her megamillionaire opponent is. That means she counts on grassroots supporters (like you!) chipping in when you can (to emails like this one!). When we see a slowdown in grassroots fundraising, Tammy can’t just cut herself a seven-figure check to make up the ground we lost. Instead, we have to make difficult decisions about where to cut our budget. And in a race as expensive and competitive as this one, we can’t afford to scale back now.

Here’s what I said. My family’sstory is America’s story. My father immigrated from Italy, went to college,was a navigator on a B-24 during World War II, came home, and was elected asthe youngest judge in New York history at 28. What a country! It’s painful tome that immigration has become so polarizing. The border is broken, and thisyear we had a bipartisan border deal. But that deal was blocked by far rightextremists! Now, we have to come together to celebrate a candidate who knowsAmerica is worth it. Who knows this nation, built by immigrants, is a rare andbeautiful thing, and who joyfully accepts the challenge to secure our border,to treat people like human beings, and to move our country forward. That’sKamala Harris! But team, we need to make sure that Kamala Harris has a partnerin Congress, and that means flipping the House! NY-03 is a must-win seat, andI’ll need your help to keep it. So team–can you split a donation between meand New Dems right now to keep me in Congress and ensure Kamala Harris has apartner to pass her agenda? »[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mc_ndaf_q32024_spl-suozzi?amount=10&amounts;=5,10,25,50,100,250,500] If you've saved your paymentinformation with ActBlue Express, your split donation between Tom Suozzi andNew Dems will go through immediately: CONTRIBUTE $10 »[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mc_ndaf_q32024_spl-suozzi?amount=10&amounts;=5,10,25,50,100,250,500&express;_lane=true]CONTRIBUTE $25 » [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mc_ndaf_q32024_spl-suozzi?amount=25&amounts;=5,10,25,50,100,250,500&express;_lane=true]CONTRIBUTE $50 » [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mc_ndaf_q32024_spl-suozzi?amount=50&amounts;=5,10,25,50,100,250,500&express;_lane=true]CONTRIBUTE $100 » [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mc_ndaf_q32024_spl-suozzi?amount=100&amounts;=5,10,25,50,100,250,500&express;_lane=true] CUSTOMAMOUNT » [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mc_ndaf_q32024_spl-suozzi?amount=25&amounts;=5,10,25,50,100,250,500] We have a lot of work to do,and I need you by my side.

That’s right – he’s dodging the opportunity to face me,and more importantly, the voters of Southwest Virginia, directly. Instead, hehas agreed to debate me on Virginia Tech radio — a station with limited reachand no live audience. Why? Because he’s scared.

And to make matters worse, he spoke at theRepublican National Convention last month — alongside extremists like DonaldTrump and JD Vance. I won't lie, friend, this is a tough race. I'm up againsta mega-millionaire who spent $64 million of his personal fortune to buy thisseat in 2018 — and he’s trying to buy it again this year. Right now, I need tocompete against the GOP's millions to retire Rick Scott and stop him fromimplementing his dangerous plans, including a nationwide ban on abortions,ending Social Security and Medicare, and raising taxes on hardworkingfamilies. Here's where your $5 could make a huge difference. Just $5 helps meput my ads on the air. Just $5 helps me meet voters up and down Florida. Just$5 helps me register new voters and get my message out to swing voters. Just$5 could be enough to defeat Rick Scott and save our Senate majority.

We need aleader who isn’t afraid to call out this insanity and stand up for REALOhioans, not the woke elite.This November, WE have a choice: continue downthis path of madness with Sherrod Brown or bring sanity back to Washington.RESTORE SANITY » Together, we can take back our country from these people,but we desperately need your support. For America, Bernie Moreno GOP Nomineefor Senate, Ohio Meet Bernie Moreno: Bernie Moreno fights for the AmericanDream because he’s lived it. Bernie was born in Bogota, Colombia. At age five,his American Dream began when he moved to the United States with his family.Bernie became an American citizen at age 18. Through his relentless work ethicand untamable entrepreneurial spirit, he turned the first car dealership thathe purchased in 2005 into one of the largest dealership groups in America. In2016, Bernie recognized the value and transformational potential of blockchaintechnology, before it received mainstream attention, and moved much of hisvolunteer time and investment dollars into the space. In 2018 he co-foundedChampTitles, which grew to be quite successful as Bernie served as Chairman ofthe Board. After a long, successful career, Bernie sold most of his businessto begin focusing on his calling: protecting the American dream for anothergeneration. Solving our country’s problems requires common sense. InWashington, Bernie will fight to shrink government, protect our freedoms, stopthe Chinese Communist party from taking our data and land, and always putAmerica First. Ohioans are done with politicians who talk a big game and donothing. Bernie wants to go to D.C. to get work done – just like he alwayshas.

In 2022, Yadira won by only 1,632 votes. Thisyear, the race could be even tighter, with Republicans already pouringmillions of dollars into Colorado to defeat us. This race is the key toflipping the House. We have a dead even partisan split, so losing thisdistrict could mean losing the House. That is why Republicans are dedicatingso many resources to flipping this seat. Crucial rights are at stake. Whetherit be lowering the cost of housing and childcare, making healthcare moreaccessible, or protecting abortion rights, Yadira is fighting for the issuesthat matter most to families. Her opponent has blocked legislation that couldease these burdens, making the lives of families even harder. Whoever wins theHouse decides the future of these freedoms. Peter, Yadira is the leader weneed to advocate for Colorado families. Can you chip in $8 to bring her onestep closer to reclaiming her seat and taking back the House?

I wanted to personally reach out and share the good news: Debbie Mucarsel-Powell just won her primary in Florida, making her the official Democratic candidate running to defeat Rick Scott in November. I couldn’t be more thrilled about this news — and I’m 100% committed to doing whatever it takes to help Debbie win this race. Will you join me in supporting Debbie by splitting $5 between her campaign and Kirsten Gillibrand's now? https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gfs_dmp?refcode=jtk5310-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250&amount;=5 Across the nation, we're seeing extremist Republicans attack the personal freedoms and rights of the American people. And now that Donald Trump and JD Vance are officially on the ballot, the stakes are even higher. With the threat of a Project 2025 future hanging over us, it's crucial for us to keep Trump and his allies out of power, which includes retiring Rick Scott from office in Florida. Not only did Rick Scott write the plan to end Social Security and Medicare, co-sponsor a national abortion ban in the Senate, and support Florida's abortion ban — one of the strictest in the nation — he also publicly endorsed Trump and Vance and their dangerous vision for America. Look: It's no surprise Floridians want him out. In fact, Rick Scott's approval rating is at an all-time low. Now, Republicans are ready to pour even more money into this battleground race to try to buy Scott's seat. That's why Debbie is counting on us — you and me, friend — to help her go up against the GOP's millions, pull ahead in the polls, and flip Florida blue. With Election Day just around the corner and only hours to go until her midnight deadline, I'm counting on top Democrats like you to chip in and help Debbie reach her biggest fundraising goal yet: $3 million. So please, will you chip in $5 — split with Kirsten Gillibrand — to help Debbie defeat Rick Scott in Florida and keep the Senate blue? https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gfs_dmp?refcode=jtk5310-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250&amount;=5 Thank you, Chuck -------- This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

He served our country in the National Guard, while Donald Trump dodged the draft. He flipped a Republican seat in Congress to Democratic control in Rural Minnesota. He won a State Championship as Coach of the High School Football team where he was also the faculty advisor to the Gay Straight Alliance. And as Governor, he has passed major Progressive reforms, including ensuring every student in Minnesota gets breakfast and lunch at school. Sounds like the kind of leader we need here in Tennessee.

Friend, Yet another poll is out on the New Mexico Senate race that shows us closing in on Martin Heinrich. Here’s what the latest poll shows: * We’re only six points down * Heinrich polling his lowest ever at only 40% * 21% of voters are undecided! Remember, this is a seat that the mainstream media is telling us was supposed to be safe blue, and the Democrats NEVER thought would be in danger. It is telling that a career politician like Heinrich—who has been in the Senate for over a decade—has 60% of voters in his “safe blue” state not ready or willing to vote for him! This is a clear sign that voters in New Mexico are fed up with the radical and destructive agenda he and the Biden-Harris regime have been pushing on us. It’s no wonder we outraised Heinrich last quarter and continue to close in on him! We have put New Mexico in play, friend—something the Left never saw coming. But closing the deal will require maintaining our momentum. The Democrats have a big surprise coming—IF you can continue to support us in this fight. We’re looking for 120 supporters to chip in within the next 36 hours to ensure we can keep the pressure on Heinrich and continue closing the gap. Can you spare a few bucks? CHIP IN NOW! Thank you again for your support! For New Mexico, Nella Domenici Republican for Senate ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici’s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella’s family’s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world’s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

America gave him a Purple Heart andI gave him my whole heart. I first met Sam Brown in the burn unit. He'd justreturned from Afghanistan where he and his soldiers were ambushed by theTaliban. He was injured by a roadside bomb and had a long road to recovery. Iwas assigned as his dietitian in rehab and was very impressed by him. Here wasa young man terribly injured while serving his country, but his heart was fullof faith. He fought with every fiber of his being to recover so he couldreturn to serve with his men in Afghanistan. And even when it became clearthat he would never be permitted to return to the line of duty on account ofhis injuries, he didn't skip a beat. Sam had to relearn everything. He hadprepared for his entire life to spend his career fighting for his country inthe military. After his life plans were dashed in just 60 seconds, he re-focused his vision on serving others in a new way. Before we were married, andbefore we were even dating, Sam and I became friends. I shared with him someof the struggles I had faced, and he was honest with me. He was concerned formy Salvation – and for that matter so was I. He challenged me to reconnectwith God and start going to church again. As he and I grew closer, he helpedme rediscover my faith. Now here we are 15 years later. We have 3 kids, I'm aBible-believing momma, and Sam is running for Senate to keep serving ournation and restore hope, leadership, and accountability. I'm endlesslygrateful that God put him in my life. Sam is a warrior, a hero, a leader. I'mbacking this Purple Heart veteran all the way and I hope you will too. Thankyou for your consideration, Captain Amy Brown U.S. Army, ret. P.S. – If youfeel so led, Sam could use your financial support.

The Florida primary is tomorrow — and now more than ever, we need to rally behind Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, who is running to defeat Sen. Rick Scott. Please, will you chip in $5 — split with Kirsten Gillibrand — to help her win? https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_dmp?refcode=jtk5308-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 I'm not exaggerating when I say the future of reproductive rights, affordable health care, Social Security and Medicare, and our very democracy hangs in the balance. And if we want to stop extremist Republicans from rolling back our rights and cutting vital programs, we need to do more than just defend our Democratic incumbents — we need to expand our razor-thin Senate majority and flip at least one red seat blue. The good news is that election experts are saying that Florida is our best pickup opportunity — and friend, you and I both know Debbie has what it takes to defeat Rick Scott in November. Her track record of public service proves she's a true champion for democracy. From writing the plan to expand Medicare to working to expand health care access to thousands of Floridians, she's committed to fighting for hardworking Americans in Florida and beyond. Donald Trump's close friend and ally, Rick Scott, can't say the same. That's why it's crucial for us to come together and rally behind Debbie so she can finally give Florida the strong leadership it deserves. Friend: This is Debbie's FINAL fundraising goal before the Florida primary tomorrow — and it's crucial that we help Debbie hit this goal. That's why I'm personally asking: Will you chip in $5 — split with Kirsten Gillibrand — to help Debbie reach her $3 million goal before midnight tonight so she can defeat Rick Scott and expand our Senate majority? https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_dmp?refcode=jtk5308-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you, Chuck -------- This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

Ijust stepped off the DNC stage and I wanted to be the first to let you knowthat this Senate race in Maryland will be one of the most important electionsof our lifetimes. And I want to make one thing clear: If we lose this race,there will be no way that Democrats will control the Senate — not a chance. SoI need your help, friend. We need to deploy volunteers to every corner ofMaryland to win over undecided voters, defeat Larry Hogan and his MAGA allies,and keep Maryland’s Senate seat blue. So will you split $5 or whatever you canspare between my campaign and Jacky Rosen’s before midnight to boost mycampaign, elect me to the Senate, and ensure that Democrats hold our Senatemajority?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/rosenfornevada_maryland?refcode=jtk4517-bu-text&amounts;=250,100,50,25,5 Look, asking for money is my least favorite partof running for office. It’s difficult to ask folks to give more than theyalready have to our campaign, but we’re at a pivotal moment. So I'm making apromise to you that whatever you give today will help fuel our fight toprotect our Democratic Senate majority. Defeating Larry Hogan will be no easyfeat. He’s already got people like Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell spending$10 MILLION to flip this seat red. But he doesn’t have what we have … agrassroots movement of dedicated supporters. It’s supporters like you who putleaders like me in office, not Hogan’s mega donors. It’s supporters like youwho work hard every day on this campaign to ensure that undecided votersaren’t left with the lies Hogan’s TV ads spread. And it’s supporters like youall over Maryland and this country that are going to fuel our efforts to winthis race and defend our Senate majority – because everything is on the linein this election. But we won’t be able to accomplish much at all without thebacking of folks like you, team. So please, can you split a donation of $5between my campaign and Jacky Rosen’s before the end of the night to make adifference and keep the Senate in Democratic hands?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/rosenfornevada_maryland?refcode=jtk4517-bu-text&amounts;=250,100,50,25,5 Thank you for stepping up, Angela Alsobrooks-------- This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

It was a competitive race that required us to spend downto near-zero to win. We're glad Democrats are now unified, but the problemwe're facing is Derrick Van Orden did not have a contested primary.

Sherrod is in the fight of his life in Ohio, and experts say thisrace could decide Senate control, so please: Give every dollar you can to helpreelect a true champion for working families.https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-wr-24?refcode=jtk2638-fr-text&amounts;=250,100,50,25,5 Here’s why I’m soworried about this race: Experts are calling Sherrod one of the mostvulnerable senators on the ballot, and national Republicans smell blood.They’re spending millions to flip this seat and the Senate red, and we justlearned Republicans are outspending us on TV ads. Now, polls show this race isneck and neck, so Sherrod’s counting on US – you and me, friend – to help himpull ahead. Unlike his wealthy self-funding opponent, Sherrod can’t write hiscampaign million-dollar checks. That’s why I set a personal goal to raise$200,000 for Sherrod’s campaign by midnight tonight, and I need you to help meget there. If we lose this race, we lose the Senate, plain and simple. Withthat in mind, will you rush $5 or more to help Sherrod win in Ohio and defendour Senate majority? https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-wr-24?refcode=jtk2638-fr-text&amounts;=250,100,50,25,5 Thank you. –Chuck Schumer -------- This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

Friend, when I saw this picture on Twitter, it instantlypissed me off. Please forgive my language, but look at the price on thebottom right: $62,000. The Vice President earns a salary of $284,000 a year.Kamala has never created a business. She’s never worked her butt off to becomepersonally wealthy. No, like many in politics, she’s enriched herself from theDC Swamp so she can afford to wear necklaces that cost more than two months'wages. This is the epitome of what the “elites” in DC have been doing tofamilies like yours and mine for decades. Right now, she’s raised over $310million to go to the White House! President Trump is the only president in mylifetime who has stood up for working families, and it’s because of this, theywant to destroy him. So I’m going to ask you for $5 now to help him getelected, but I can assure you of this, your donation won’t go towards a$62,000 necklace. It won’t go to enriching the DC Swamp who hates yourvalues. It will go towards electing the only man who can save America: DonaldJ. Trump. So only if you can afford it, can you chip in just $5 now? > DONATETODAY I know $5 is a lot of money in America today.

Ifyou’re the leader of the Chinese Communist Party, you couldn’t be happier withtheir candidacy. A Harris-Walz administration will continue the same wrong-headed policies of the Biden presidency that have enabled China’s rapideconomic growth and expanding influence in the Indo-Pacific and around theworld. Under a Harris-Walz administration, America will be more, not less,reliant on China. Allied confidence in Washington’s resolve will weaken, notstrengthen. Under their government, rather than prioritizing strategiccompetition, they will be pursuing a radical domestic agenda. Their EVmandates, which are wrong for the country and wrong for global stability, arejust one example.

This race istightening, even with Brown’s big fundraising advantage that we’ve beenworking to overcome. What happens in this race will not only affect the futureof Ohio, but it will decide the Senate majority... And with Senate Democratspushing an agenda that includes communist-style economic takeovers, packingthe Supreme Court, and giving voting rights to the millions of illegals theyallowed across the border,the fate of our nation rests on victory in Ohio aswell. It’s clear what we must do. I need to ask you to give this fightanything you can in order to win. Brown’s resources are the ONLY reason he’sstill ahead in this race, and we need to eliminate that advantage. Whether youcan give $500 or just $5 right now, every patriot who cares about protectingour country from the increasingly radical left must chip in to support victoryin this race. GIVE $500 » GIVE $5 » GIVE OTHER AMOUNT » Time is runningout to pull ahead – we need to kick it into overdrive now. For America, BernieMoreno GOP Nominee for Senate, Ohio Meet Bernie Moreno: Bernie Moreno fightsfor the American Dream because he’s lived it. Bernie was born in Bogota,Colombia. At age five, his American Dream began when he moved to the UnitedStates with his family. Bernie became an American citizen at age 18. Throughhis relentless work ethic and untamable entrepreneurial spirit, he turned thefirst car dealership that he purchased in 2005 into one of the largestdealership groups in America. In 2016, Bernie recognized the value andtransformational potential of blockchain technology, before it receivedmainstream attention, and moved much of his volunteer time and investmentdollars into the space. In 2018 he co-founded ChampTitles, which grew to bequite successful as Bernie served as Chairman of the Board. After a long,successful career, Bernie sold most of his business to begin focusing on hiscalling: protecting the American dream for another generation.

Hi Friend, it’s Rebecca Cooke – the Democratic nominee in WI-03 – a key battleground that could decide House control. I want to share more about why I believe we have a prime opportunity to unseat Derrick Van Orden and flip Wisconsin’s 3rd District. But first, I want to tell you my story, why I'm in this race, and why we need community champions in Congress. I hope you'll read the whole email, then consider splitting a donation to support myself and Nikki Budzinski to flip the House and improve lives in western Wisconsin and beyond.

Growing up on my family’s farm, I learned the importance of hard work and resilience from an early age. Money was tight, but my parents worked hard to open doors of opportunity for me. https://secure.actblue.com/donate/njb-em-cooke [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/njb-em-cooke] I spent my summers showing our registered Holsteins around the state. Their example, and my love for this community, are why I built my business, Red's Mercantile, right here in Eau Claire to amplify American-made products made by homegrown talent. It's also why I launched a nonprofit called the Red Letter Grant to help women entrepreneurs start main-street businesses throughout Western Wisconsin. It wasn’t long before folks started to take notice. I became the youngest woman appointed by Governor Tony Evers to the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation , where I continued working on growing entrepreneurship and innovation across our state. https://secure.actblue.com/donate/njb-em-cooke [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/njb-em-cooke] Awarding the first Red Letter Grants to Wisconsin’s future entrepreneurs. https://secure.actblue.com/donate/njb-em-cooke [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/njb-em-cooke] At my old shop, Red’s Mercantile. Friend: we are at a crossroads. We have so much potential, but unfortunately, too many working-class families can’t afford healthcare or find affordable housing. Our rural communities struggle with poor infrastructure, lack of internet access, and many family farms -- like the one I grew up on -- are suffering. We need a homegrown, working class representative who understands these issues firsthand – not extreme politicians like Derrick Van Orden. Van Orden has never come clean about his presence at the Capitol on Jan. 6, and wants to take away reproductive freedom from the women of Wisconsin and beyond. We can remove him – folks are calling our race one of the key seats Democrats need to flip the House. But unlike Van Orden, this campaign is powered by individual donors, so I’m relying on folks like you to push us over the top this time around. If you’re ready, please split a donation between myself and Nikki Budzinski today to give our campaigns a boost.

As a mother of three school-aged kids and the proud product ofVirginia public schools, I know that our public education system is one of themost important tools we have to set our kids up for success. As extremists inVirginia and across the country try to politicize our schools, pit parentsagainst teachers, and ban books in school libraries, I know we have moreimportant things to focus on – issues that really matter. As Governor, I willwork to address the teacher shortage, contend with learning loss, and makeeffective investments in Virginia’s public schools to make sure we’re buildingthe next generation of leaders.

This race is tightening, evenwith Brown’s big fundraising advantage that we’ve been working to overcome.What happens in this race will not only affect the future of Ohio, but it willdecide the Senate majority... And with Senate Democrats pushing an agenda thatincludes communist-style economic takeovers, packing the Supreme Court, andgiving voting rights to the millions of illegals they allowed across theborder,the fate of our nation rests on victory in Ohio as well. It’s clearwhat we must do. I need to ask you to give this fight anything you can inorder to win. Brown’s resources are the ONLY reason he’s still ahead in thisrace, and we need to eliminate that advantage.

Bernie Moreno has pulled to within 4 points ofliberal Senator Sherrod Brown in what may be the closest Senate race of 2024.There are two huge data points in this poll, which shows Brown with 46% andMoreno with 42%. First, it shows Moreno has cut Brown’s lead in half sinceMay. Second, this is the first poll of the cycle with Brown under 50%! This isa HUGE problem for incumbent candidates who are universally known in theirstates. It’s a signal that Ohio votersdo not support Sherrod Brown and arelooking for new leadership. This would be a major story even if this race werea fair fight. But it’s not. As a lifelong politician and chairman of theSenate Banking Committee, Sherrod Brown’s campaign is cashing checks fromspecial interests left and right. He has spentFOUR TIMES AS MUCH as Moreno.Yet despite a hurricane of false attacks from Sherrod Brown and the press,Moreno has closed the Ohio Senate race to a statistical dead heat.Why? Becausehis message is finally breaking through. Ohio is a red state, and SherrodBrown is as blue as any Democrat in Washington. Unlike Brown, Moreno actuallyrepresents the people and the values of the Buckeye State. Bernie Moreno is aprincipled conservative who will fight for border security, a strong economy,school choice, American energy, a strong military, medical freedom, andelection integrity!! But this means he will face the worst from the radicalLeft. They don’t want Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Ron Johnson, and Josh Hawley to haveconservative reinforcements. So, it’s up to patriots across the country toclose the gap. Bernie Moreno has the message — now he needs the resources.Please rush a contribution to Bernie Moreno’s campaign. SCF will pay allprocessing fees and transfer 100% of your contribution directly to hiscampaign. Supporting candidates through SCF is the best way to help them win.Candidates often have to pay fundraising vendors 80% of your contribution tohelp them raise online contributions, but when you donate to candidatesthrough SCF, they pay nothing. This allows them to spend your entirecontribution on voter contact to win. Support Berneo Moreno now! Democratshave seen this new poll, too. Millions in special interest cash will soon pourinto Ohio to rescue Sherrod Brown. It’s going to be one of the most expensiveSenate races in history. Thank you for considering this urgent request and fordoing so much to help fight for America's future.

That’s why we are over the moon that Fox News is declaring a Democratic advantage in one of those districts . But the simple fact of the matter is that we cannot afford to phone it in. In 2022, there were numerous U.S. House seats decided by only a handful of votes. And now that Fox News is saying that Democrats are favored, you better believe that Republican dark money will be swarming California within seconds . We have a plan that is working . We’ve hired organizers earlier than ever, opened regional offices, and reached out to hundreds of thousands of undecided voters. Now, we want to keep scaling and growing our campaign in CA-27 and every single tossup district in our state. Will you rush a donation right now to make that happen? We want to raise $10,000 before midnight tonight and every gift counts!

How quickly we fall off their radar once the election is over. But just because they forgot about us, doesn’t mean I forgot about you. I saw families forced to move into motels after losing their jobs during the pandemic, and I worked with them to find alternatives to housing. I saw food deserts cause rampant food insecurity throughout our district, and I worked with my mother to open a food bank.

Politicalexperts rank this race a toss-up, which means your gift will have a hugeimpact on our ability to raise the resources we need to win. 2. Tim Sheehy iswrong for Montana. He wants to privatize health care, sell off our publiclands, and would support a national abortion ban. 3. Mitch McConnell isdesperate to beat me. He named me one of his top targets, and outside groupsare spending millions to pummel me with attacks. 4. Their attacks are working.The polls have tightened into a statistical tie, and this race couldn’t be anycloser—your $7 will help us pull ahead. 5. I won my first Senate race by just3,562 votes… and this election could be even closer. 6. We’re less than 100days out from Election Day, and we’re falling behind in our fundraising. If wecan’t afford to keep our ads up, our opponent’s attacks will drown us out. 7.We can’t win without you. If every person reading this chipped in $7, we’dhave the resources we need to overcome the attacks, break our tie in thepolls, and win this race. But not everyone will, so I’m asking you personally,Peter. Can I count on you to make a split donation of $7 or more between mycampaign and Letitia James? Your support today could mean the differencebetween victory and defeat. https://secure.actblue.com/donate/james-for-ny-24-tester?refcode=jtk1575-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 If we win inMontana, we can defend the Montana way of life, safeguard a woman’s right tomake her own health care decisions, and protect our public lands forgenerations to come. —Jon -------- This email was sent todpwillis67@gmail.com.

My mother was a teenager when I was born and she struggled with addiction. I never met my father. But I had two incredible grandparents who stepped in and raised me. Everything I know, I learned from them. In every way a child needs, my grandparents were there for me. As they grew older, it was my privilege to be there for them. So, when I work to protect Medicare and Social Security, I do it with the personal knowledge of what those big programs meant in small but deeply meaningful ways to my grandparents. I know what they mean for your parents and grandparents. But let’s be clear: That is all at risk today. Right-wing extremists like Donald Trump and my opponent, Eric Hovde, want to bring us back in time. If they had it their way, they’d cut Social Security and Medicare. Overturn the Affordable Care Act. Further restrict our reproductive rights. Give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations while our working families foot the bill. We can’t let that happen, and as long as we stand together, I know we won’t. This November, we have the opportunity to move our country forward — to protect and expand affordable health care, restore reproductive rights, cut costs for working families, and protect Social Security and Medicare for our parents and grandparents. But it will take ALL of us.

It's finally primary day, and let me tell you, theenergy on the ground here in Miami is positively electric! While I can'tpredict the final outcome of this primary, based on my talks with voters inline, there are three major takeaways I've gathered so far: 1) People are sickand tired of Rick Scott and his creepy, controlling policies — and a brand-newpoll showing him at a staggering 35% approval rating among Florida voters onlygoes to prove it. 2) From the key endorsements of both local and nationalleaders to the ongoing support of this grassroots team and the countlessvoters already in line to cast a ballot in my primary, I know we have what ittakes to win. 3) With the race between me and Rick Scott so close in thepolls, the ultimate winner in November will be whoever has the resources anddrive to reach as many Floridians as possible.https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk1713-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 If all things go according to plan today, thenfrom tomorrow onward, we've got to pull out all the stops: expanding our get-out-the-vote efforts, knocking on doors, traveling to every corner of thestate, and getting my ads on the air. But that's just the thing — so will RickScott. If I want to actually compete with my ultra-wealthy opponent's self-funded campaign, fight back against their massive ad spends, and win, it'sgoing to take every single member of this grassroots team giving it our all.So I've got to ask: Can I count on you to have my back throughout today'sDemocratic primary and all the way to November? If so, then please, friend,chip in $5, $25, or anything you can spare to help me finish the primaryseason strong.https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk1713-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you for everything — let's get this done.Debbie PS – By the way, if you were one of the 158,937 people who surprised mewith their endorsement this morning, I truly can't thank you enough.

Peter, Yet another poll is out on the New Mexico Senate race that shows us closing in on Martin Heinrich. Here’s what the latest poll shows: * We’re only six points down * Heinrich polling his lowest ever at only 40% * 21% of voters are undecided! Remember, this is a seat that the mainstream media is telling us was supposed to be safe blue, and the Democrats NEVER thought would be in danger. It is telling that a career politician like Heinrich—who has been in the Senate for over a decade—has 60% of voters in his “safe blue” state not ready or willing to vote for him! This is a clear sign that voters in New Mexico are fed up with the radical and destructive agenda he and the Biden-Harris regime have been pushing on us. It’s no wonder we outraised Heinrich last quarter and continue to close in on him! We have put New Mexico in play, Peter—something the Left never saw coming. But closing the deal will require maintaining our momentum. The Democrats have a big surprise coming—IF you can continue to support us in this fight. We’re looking for 120 supporters to chip in within the next 36 hours to ensure we can keep the pressure on Heinrich and continue closing the gap. Can you spare a few bucks? CHIP IN NOW! Thank you again for your support! For New Mexico, Nella Domenici Republican for Senate ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici’s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella’s family’s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world’s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

These attacks are not only misleading but also designed to misinform andconfuse voters about Maggie’s background and her vision for NH-02. We knewthis would be a tough race, but we didn’t expect our opponent to go this low.Maggie has spent her career fighting for the underdogs, standing up tobullies, fighting for reproductive freedom, and advocating for justice forall. She’s brought that same tenacity and fight to her campaign for Congress,which she’s run based on honesty, integrity, and a clear vision for ourcommunity. But to ensure that our message is heard above the noise of theseattacks, we need your support more than ever. With just three weeks left untilthe primary, we’re running out of time. So, will you contribute to Maggie’scampaign today to counter these attacks and help us continue showing votersacross NH-02 that Maggie is the right candidate for the job?

Here's how we know: FIRST: Trump handpicked Moreno to runagainst Sherrod and personally came to Ohio to throw a rally for him. THEN:Trump offered Moreno use of his personal club, Mar-a-Lago, for a bougiefundraiser where they raised $350,000 from MAGA megadonors. NOW: Moreno is100% Team MAGA with CNN reporting he is ""simply trying to ride Trump’scoattails"" to victory in November. If Moreno wins, he'll do whatever Trumpwants. We can't let that happen, friend – but polls show this race isstatistically tied, which means it's more important than ever to make sureSherrod has the resources he needs to fight back.

My friend, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell,just WON her primary and is the official Democratic nominee for our criticalSenate race! And friend, if Debbie wins in November, Democrats are virtuallyguaranteed to hold the Senate. The tides are shifting here in Florida. Justlook at a new poll that came out showing Kamala Harris within the margin oferror for winning Florida and stopping Donald Trump. Just look at the energyon the ground for compassionate leaders like Debbie who are fighting for ourfreedoms and democracy. I truly believe Debbie has what it takes to flipFlorida blue and protect our state and nation from the dangerous agenda DonaldTrump and his far-right loyalists. But with the general election in full swing— and Florida having one of the most competitive and expensive media marketsin the country — Debbie needs your grassroots support more than ever to spreadher message and win.

Public service is ingrained inDebbie — and it's probably because she's never taken for granted theopportunities she's been afforded or her own American Dream she's been able tocreate. You see, Debbie grew up in a one room apartment, and her mother — whobrought her here from Ecuador — worked tirelessly to provide a better life forDebbie and her sisters, so they could achieve their American dream. Debbieherself worked minimum wage jobs to help the family get by. Her story remindsme a lot of my own, growing up in a two room house in Tallahassee with sixbrothers and sisters.

Peter, A new poll on the Ohio Senate race showsus trailing Sherrod Brown by just 5 points – right at the margin of error,making it a virtual tie. This race is tightening, even with Brown’s bigfundraising advantage that we’ve been working to overcome. What happens inthis race will not only affect the future of Ohio, but it will decide theSenate majority... And with Senate Democrats pushing an agenda that includescommunist-style economic takeovers, packing the Supreme Court, and givingvoting rights to the millions of illegals they allowed across the border,thefate of our nation rests on victory in Ohio as well. It’s clear what we mustdo. I need to ask you to give this fight anything you can in order to win.Brown’s resources are the ONLY reason he’s still ahead in this race, and weneed to eliminate that advantage. Whether you can give $500 or just $5 rightnow, every patriot who cares about protecting our country from theincreasingly radical left must chip in to support victory in this race.

At age five, hisAmerican Dream began when he moved to the United States with his family.Bernie became an American citizen at age 18. Through his relentless work ethicand untamable entrepreneurial spirit, he turned the first car dealership thathe purchased in 2005 into one of the largest dealership groups in America. In2016, Bernie recognized the value and transformational potential of blockchaintechnology, before it received mainstream attention, and moved much of hisvolunteer time and investment dollars into the space. In 2018 he co-foundedChampTitles, which grew to be quite successful as Bernie served as Chairman ofthe Board. After a long, successful career, Bernie sold most of his businessto begin focusing on his calling: protecting the American dream for anothergeneration. Solving our country’s problems requires common sense. InWashington, Bernie will fight to shrink government, protect our freedoms, stopthe Chinese Communist party from taking our data and land, and always putAmerica First.

Throughhis relentless work ethic and untamable entrepreneurial spirit, he turned thefirst car dealership that he purchased in 2005 into one of the largestdealership groups in America. In 2016, Bernie recognized the value andtransformational potential of blockchain technology, before it receivedmainstream attention, and moved much of his volunteer time and investmentdollars into the space. In 2018 he co-founded ChampTitles, which grew to bequite successful as Bernie served as Chairman of the Board. After a long,successful career, Bernie sold most of his business to begin focusing on hiscalling: protecting the American dream for another generation.

But nowthat she’s his party’s presidential nominee, he’s refusing to endorse herpublicly and is skipping the DNC. That’s fishy… Could it be because he’s themost vulnerable incumbent running for reelection?

Or could Jon Tester be hiding from the pressand skipping his party’s most crucial confab in the last four years becauseKamala Harris is like Kryptonite to Montana voters? Though Tester believeshe’s being inconspicuous, his motives couldn’t be clearer:he wants to hide thepolicies he supports and the candidates he has hitched his wagon to in thepast because they’re wildly out of step with everyday Americans.

As a high-schooler, she began volunteering as a clinic escort at herlocal Women’s Surgical Clinic. She found that the clinic and the region, as awhole, were constantly under attack by anti-choice protestors, and she becamea target of these aggressors.

Well, it can make a pretty big one. The mostsuccessful movements in our history have been people-powered – like-mindedfolks coming together to move the needle on things that seem really big, evenuntouchable.

The Democratic National Convention kicksoff today, and I can't wait to tune in and see Democrats from across thecountry come together in Chicago to keep the White House blue. Over the lastfour weeks, the grassroots energy on the ground leading up to this moment hasbeen undeniable — but as much as I'd love to be there and soak it up inperson, I've got to keep my focus entirely on Florida. Why? Because my primaryelection is tomorrow. I'm confident I can come out victorious, but in order tokeep up the fight for Florida's future once the ballots are tallied, I needyour help tonight. Will you please pitch in $5 or more toward my $3 millionpre-primary goal to help me flip Florida blue?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk1709-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 So you might be thinking, “With less than 36hours until the polls close, what good is my donation at this point?” Here'sthe thing: Florida's last Senate race was decided by just 10,033 votes. And ina state with 13.4 MILLION registered voters, that's not a lot. Battlegroundraces like these can be won or lost by just a handful of ballots. So eventhough I'm polling neck and neck against Rick Scott — and his approval justdropped to an abysmal 35% — we can't afford to be too confident, just tofalter before we even cross the finish line. That's why the team and I havebeen going full speed ahead. I’ve been all over the state, from Tampa, toGainesville, to the Keys in the last week — and I’m not stopping. We're racingto connect with voters across the Sunshine State, spread the word about thisgrassroots movement, and make sure Florida voters know we have a realalternative to another six years with an out-of-touch extremist like RickScott at the helm — because after tomorrow, we're in the final stretch. Inshort, we can't hold back now. So please friend: Will you chip in $5, $25, oranything you can to help me give this everything I've got and ensure we startout the final leg of this Senate race strong enough to win this fall?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk1709-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Unidos, venceremos — together, we've got this.Thank you, Debbie -------- This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

I couldn't have gotten this far without supporters like you, and as we enter the final lap of the race, your continued support is the only way I'll win — especially when recent polls show this race statistically tied. Even though CNN calls Rick Scott one of the most vulnerable senators on the map, his campaign still has hundreds of millions of dollars of his personal fortune at its disposal to fuel the most bizarre and dishonest attack ads possible about me. I need my message to beat his to the chase, and I can't do that without you. So with the primary behind us, the real battle begins now — and I'm counting on 20,000 supporters getting on board by midnight to show the GOP that our grassroots movement is unstoppable. Please, will you donate $5 to split between me and Kirsten Gillibrand and become an official General Election Founding Donor, help me retire Rick Scott, and flip Florida blue? https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gfs_dmp?refcode=jtk5316-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 DMP Founding Donor Graphic https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gfs_dmp?refcode=jtk5316-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thing is, friend, this race was always bigger than just me defeating Rick Scott. There's so much more at stake, like stopping a Scott-run Senate from green-lighting all of Trump's worst authoritarian whims or holding the Supreme Court accountable and saving abortion here in Florida. And with not just Scott but shady outside entities spending millions to keep Florida red, our reproductive freedoms under their thumb, and our voices silenced, we can't have anyone sitting on the sidelines from here on out. Our movement is now closer than ever to flipping Florida blue, so if you're with me in this from now until November, then please, friend: Will you be one of the first people to become a General Election Founding Donor with your donation of $5 or more to split between me and Kirsten Gillibrand today? https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gfs_dmp?refcode=jtk5316-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Truly, thank you so much for believing in me and this movement — I hope to see your name on that list.

First, remember what we're up against in the2024 election: We are in the middle of the worst border crisis in our history:a nation without borders will NOT last. Young people have lost pride inAmerica, and we have a recruitment crisis in our military. The Department ofJustice and local jurisdictions are using lawfare to go after AmericanPatriots - from Donald Trump to everyday citizens across our country. Unipartypoliticians in D.C. don't care about any of this and continue to sell outAmerican interests. Our grandchildren will read about 2024 in their historybooks. Whether it's in a GOOD way or not depends on YOU. Since I ended mypresidential campaign, I've considered what I ought to do with my time,energy, and resources to continue fighting the America-First movement and ourcountry… So here is my BIG announcement: Turning Point PAC is fundingnecessary ballot chasers in key swing states in order to win our country backin 2024. The groundwork is laid. But Charlie Kirk needs to raise $50,000 tokeep these activists on the ground and fund the operation. I PROMISED toCharlie that I would help him reach this goal and WIN the House, Senate, andWhite House in 2024! As a personal favor to me, can you please donate $10,$20.24, $50, $100, $250, or even $1,000 before midnight and help Turning PointPAC fund ballot chasers? DONATE The media continues to lie to us. The justicesystem is politicized. And America-last politicians in D.C. don't care aboutit. Turning Point PAC is doing what needs to be done to win. It's notglamorous work in front of the media limelight. But the PAC is funding thesuccess of these ballot chasers to make sure every vote is counted, andAmericans get out in droves in 2024. Please join me in supporting TurningPoint PAC with a donation of ANYTHING you can generously contribute today.Donate $10 Donate $20.24 Donate $50 Donate $100 Donate $250 Donate $500 Donate$1,000 Donate ANY Amount The reality is it will require all of us to step upto win in November. It can be by volunteering your time for Get Out the Voteefforts. It can be by making sure your family votes. Or, you can chip in $10or more today and help us win in November.

I have an important update for you: There are just 2 days until the Florida Primary. It's because of people like you that I'm here today, running in a battleground race that could determine the fate of our Senate majority and the next Senate majority leader. Thank you, friend. With everything from abortion rights to Social Security and Medicare on the line, November 5th could be the end of our democracy as we know it. That’s why it’s critical for us to do everything we can to defend our Senate majority from far-right extremists like Rick Scott, JD Vance, and Donald Trump.

They'll roll back voting rights and reproductive freedom — even more so than they already have — cut critical government programs like Social Security and Medicare, and end the Affordable Care Act. I’ve spent my life serving Floridians because I listen to and care about our communities. I've helped protect the Everglades, worked at the state and national level to expand health care access, and fought to defend reproductive rights. I won’t let Rick Scott continue to scheme and lie just to advance his self-serving agenda and the interests of his ultra-wealthy friends. Our race in Florida could determine both control of the Senate and the next Senate majority leader, which means it’s more important than ever to protect our Democratic Senate majority.

This is one of the most expensive races in the entire country. Eric Hovde has already self-funded his campaign with $13 million of his own personal fortune. And as of this week, Hovde and his right-wing allies are outspending us on the airwaves. It’s also one of the most competitive races in the nation. A slew of recent polls show this race is statistically tied, and Hovde’s campaign has promoted internal polling that even shows him taking the lead. Defending this seat is going to require a lot of resources, but unlike my opponent, I can’t cut myself seven-figure checks to keep our ads live and reach voters across this battleground state. Instead, I’m counting on your support.

And as a Floridarepresentative, as someone who grew up in public schools in Florida, and assomeone who sees Florida youth affected by DeSantis’ fascist policies, this ispersonal to me. It’s also undeniable: DeSantis has proven again and again thathe does not care about protecting our youth. Instead, he and his extremistbuddies are going after education at every school grade level in Florida,depriving students of their basic rights. We need to stand as a collective tokeep DeSantis and all his far-right extreme cronies from putting Florida youthin danger. But I have to be able to fund this fight – and I’m falling short ofmy End-of-Summer goal. This public deadline is the perfect time to show theFlorida GOP we're ready to fight back at full force.

Peter, I ran for Congress becauseI’ve been fighting people like DeSantis for years, but I know I could not doit alone.

Fellow patriot, Anew poll on the Ohio Senate race shows us trailing Sherrod Brown by just 5points – right at the margin of error, making it a virtual tie. This race istightening, even with Brown’s big fundraising advantage that we’ve beenworking to overcome. What happens in this race will not only affect the futureof Ohio, but it will decide the Senate majority... And with Senate Democratspushing an agenda that includes communist-style economic takeovers, packingthe Supreme Court, and giving voting rights to the millions of illegals theyallowed across the border,the fate of our nation rests on victory in Ohio aswell. It’s clear what we must do. I need to ask you to give this fightanything you can in order to win. Brown’s resources are the ONLY reason he’sstill ahead in this race, and we need to eliminate that advantage. Whether youcan give $500 or just $5 right now, every patriot who cares about protectingour country from the increasingly radical left must chip in to support victoryin this race. GIVE $500 » GIVE $5 » GIVE OTHER AMOUNT » Time is runningout to pull ahead – we need to kick it into overdrive now. For America, BernieMoreno GOP Nominee for Senate, Ohio Meet Bernie Moreno: Bernie Moreno fightsfor the American Dream because he’s lived it. Bernie was born in Bogota,Colombia. At age five, his American Dream began when he moved to the UnitedStates with his family. Bernie became an American citizen at age 18. Throughhis relentless work ethic and untamable entrepreneurial spirit, he turned thefirst car dealership that he purchased in 2005 into one of the largestdealership groups in America. In 2016, Bernie recognized the value andtransformational potential of blockchain technology, before it receivedmainstream attention, and moved much of his volunteer time and investmentdollars into the space. In 2018 he co-founded ChampTitles, which grew to bequite successful as Bernie served as Chairman of the Board. After a long,successful career, Bernie sold most of his business to begin focusing on hiscalling: protecting the American dream for another generation. Solving ourcountry’s problems requires common sense. In Washington, Bernie will fight toshrink government, protect our freedoms, stop the Chinese Communist party fromtaking our data and land, and always put America First. Ohioans are done withpoliticians who talk a big game and do nothing. Bernie wants to go to D.C. toget work done – just like he always has.

Bernie Moreno has pulled to within 4 points ofliberal Senator Sherrod Brown in what may be the closest Senate race of 2024.There are two huge data points in this poll, which shows Brown with 46% andMoreno with 42%. First, it shows Moreno has cut Brown’s lead in half sinceMay. Second, this is the first poll of the cycle with Brown under 50%! This isa HUGE problem for incumbent candidates who are universally known in theirstates. It’s a signal that Ohio votersdo not support Sherrod Brown and arelooking for new leadership. This would be a major story even if this race werea fair fight. But it’s not. As a lifelong politician and chairman of theSenate Banking Committee, Sherrod Brown’s campaign is cashing checks fromspecial interests left and right. He has spentFOUR TIMES AS MUCH as Moreno.Yet despite a hurricane of false attacks from Sherrod Brown and the press,Moreno has closed the Ohio Senate race to a statistical dead heat.Why? Becausehis message is finally breaking through. Ohio is a red state, and SherrodBrown is as blue as any Democrat in Washington. Unlike Brown, Moreno actuallyrepresents the people and the values of the Buckeye State. Bernie Moreno is aprincipled conservative who will fight for border security, a strong economy,school choice, American energy, a strong military, medical freedom, andelection integrity!! But this means he will face the worst from the radicalLeft. They don’t want Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Ron Johnson, and Josh Hawley to haveconservative reinforcements. So, it’s up to patriots across the country toclose the gap. Bernie Moreno has the message — now he needs the resources.Please rush a contribution to Bernie Moreno’s campaign. SCF will pay allprocessing fees and transfer 100% of your contribution directly to hiscampaign. Supporting candidates through SCF is the best way to help them win.Candidates often have to pay fundraising vendors 80% of your contribution tohelp them raise online contributions, but when you donate to candidatesthrough SCF, they pay nothing. This allows them to spend your entirecontribution on voter contact to win. Support Bernie Moreno now! Democratshave seen this new poll, too. Millions in special interest cash will soon pourinto Ohio to rescue Sherrod Brown. It’s going to be one of the most expensiveSenate races in history. Thank you for considering this urgent request and fordoing so much to help fight for America's future.

But here’s the thing: abortion will also be, literally, on the ballot inFlorida in November. Florida currently has an extreme 6-week abortion ban ineffect. Due to this ban, women across the South have been forced to travelhundreds or even thousands of miles to get life-saving care. We are writingtoday because there is a diligent and organized effort ON THE GROUND inFlorida working tirelessly to reverse this ban: our partners, the FloridaWomen’s Freedom Coalition. Their team continues to work hard to ensureFloridians VOTE to pass a proposed constitutional amendment to safeguardabortion access in Florida.

This is a make-or-break moment for Florida. This vote will give the power back to the VOTERSinstead of anti-choice GOP lawmakers and judges. We know Floridians want toprotect the right to full reproductive healthcare, not restrict it. They’llhave a chance to make their voices heard in November – but our partners inFlorida need our immediate support to get voter turnout high enough to breakthe 60% threshold needed to get this measure passed. That part will be achallenge. We cannot allow this 6-week abortion ban to stand – and we have achance to change it.

But lemme tell ya – I just got off the phone, and I almost fell outof my chair when I heard the bad news about Jacky Rosen’s Senate race inNevada. I’ll break down the nitty-gritty in a second, but if you alreadyunderstand the stakes of this election, PLEASE chip in $5 to Jacky’sreelection campaign ASAP.

MAGA Republicans are only one battlegroundseat away from taking back control of the Senate, so they made unseating Jackya TOP priority. Here’s what happened: Donald Trump and national Republicansunleashed wave after wave of attacks against Jacky. Trump even singled outNevada’s Senate race during his RNC speech to ridicule her – and ever since,right-wing billionaires have poured millions of dollars more into Nevada toflip it red. Here’s where we are now: With Trump back in Nevada today, theirattacks are ramping up, and the GOP’s ads are now drowning out Jacky on theairwaves – just when Democrats need to surge in this MUST-WIN battlegroundrace that the polls say is in a statistical tie. There’s no pretty way to putit: We need to turn this around STAT … or we’re TOTALLY COOKED. Nevada’s lastSenate race was decided by just 7,928 votes – so if Jacky’s opponent gets awaywith misleading persuadable swing voters at this rate, Democrats don’t stand achance in hell of keeping our Senate majority. Jacky desperately needs tocombat the GOP’s lies and spread her message to every corner of Nevada, so herteam set an ambitious goal to raise another $150,000 TODAY to help scale upher advertising program ASAP. But with hours to go until her next invoice isdue, she’s falling dangerously behind. I’m counting on you to step up and helpus at this critical moment. PLEASE will you chip in $5 - which will become $10- so Jacky Rosen can win in Nevada and protect our fragile Senate majority?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/rosenfornevada_email_augmatch_2024?refcode=jtk4582-fr-text&amounts;=250,100,50,25,5 There couldn’t be a more important time for youto get off the sidelines.

THEN: States across the country with histories of racial discriminationwere free to jam through harsh voter suppression laws, including strict voterID requirements, cuts to early voting days, and the removal of ballot dropboxes. NOW: A recent ruling from the 5th Circuit threatens to further unravelthe Voting Rights Act by making it harder to challenge discriminatory maps incourt.

Last summer, the fair maps movement wonbig at the Supreme Court in Allen v. Milligan . The ruling protected Section 2of the Voting Rights Act and led to new maps across the region.

Everywhere you looked, the politicalpundits were calling Colorado’s 3rd congressional district “Safe Republican”or “Solid R.” Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight only gave Adam a 3% chance ofdefeating Boebert. They projected he’d lose by over 45,000 votes!https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email?refcode=em20240819mid-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=597d3c1b-445e-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b&recurring;=true[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email?refcode=em20240819mid-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=597d3c1b-445e-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b&recurring;=true]Inthe end, though, the race went to a recount. Lauren Boebert won by just 546votes, and Adam lost the closest race in the entire country. Because here’swhat their “models” and “forecasts” didn’t factor in: Adam put in the work. Hetraveled 24,000 miles in our red pickup truck to every corner of the district.He met thousands and thousands of voters – and he listened . Now, LaurenBoebert's run off scared, and I’ll be honest: The first campaign was hard. Butwinning this House seat is now going to be even harder. Adam’s all-in tofinish the job in 2024. I’m all-in. Can we count on you? Please, if you canafford to, will you chip in $5 or more right now to Adam’s campaign to helphim win this critical House seat? We were outspent in 2022 and just barelylost.

Here are 7 reasons why yourdonation today is so important (that’s one for every finger!):[http://secure.actblue.com/donate/losecruz_2024-tester] 1. Political expertsrank this race a toss-up, which means your gift will have a huge impact on ourability to raise the resources we need to win. 2. Tim Sheehy is wrong forMontana . He wants to privatize health care, sell off our public lands, andwould support a national abortion ban. 3. Mitch McConnell is desperate to beatme. He named me one of his top targets, and outside groups are spendingmillions to pummel me with attacks. 4. Their attacks are working. The pollshave tightened into a statistical tie, and this race couldn’t be anycloser—your $7 will help us pull ahead. 5. I won my first Senate race by just3,562 votes … and this election could be even closer. 6. We’re less than 100days out from Election Day, and we’re falling behind in our fundraising . Ifwe can’t afford to keep our ads up, our opponent’s attacks will drown us out.7. We can’t win without you. If every person reading this chipped in $7, we’dhave the resources we need to overcome the attacks, break our tie in thepolls, and win this race. But not everyone will, so I’m asking you personally:Can I count on you to make a split donation of $7 or more between my campaignand Lose Cruz? Your support today could mean the difference between victoryand defeat.

And as a Floridarepresentative, as someone who grew up in public schools in Florida, and assomeone who sees Florida youth affected by DeSantis’ fascist policies, this ispersonal to me. It’s also undeniable: DeSantis has proven again and again thathe does not care about protecting our youth. Instead, he and his extremistbuddies are going after education at every school grade level in Florida,depriving students of their basic rights. We need to stand as a collective tokeep DeSantis and all his far-right extreme cronies from putting Florida youthin danger. But I have to be able to fund this fight – and I’m falling short ofmy End-of-Summer goal. This public deadline is the perfect time to show theFlorida GOP we're ready to fight back at full force.

This one didn’t make a huge splash amidst the other insane things he said, but it stood out to me: ""If anybody I know is Jewish and they would vote for Kamala over me, they should have their heads examined."" Well, I am Jewish. And I am proudly going to cast my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris. But I certainly don’t want my head examined by Donald Trump. I’m proud of my Jewish faith, Derek. From a young age, Judaism has guided my values. Especially the teaching of Tikkun Olam, or repairing the world. Over the last few years, there has been a lot that was broken, and a lot to fix. But Tikkun Olam guides me in the fight we face today: repairing and rebuilding our democracy so that we leave it better for my children and yours. That’s why I put everything I have into my work in Congress and for the cause of our democracy. It’s the first thing I think about when I wake up in the morning, and I don’t rest until I’ve done all I can for the day.

So much is on the line this year, from abortion access to betterwages and working conditions to our fundamental right to vote. Future progresson all of these issues depends on protecting our razor-thin Democratic Senatemajority – and if we wait until the fall to take action, it’ll already be toolate. That’s why I’m asking you to support my friend and colleague SherrodBrown today.

Now, polls show this race is neck and neck, so Sherrod’scounting on US – you and me, friend – to help him pull ahead. Unlike hiswealthy self-funding opponent, Sherrod can’t write his campaign million-dollarchecks. That’s why I set a personal goal to raise $75,000 for Sherrod’scampaign by midnight tonight, and I need you to help me get there. If we losethis race, we lose the Senate, plain and simple.

Governor Nancy Dahlstrom for Congress. Stauberendorsed Dahlstrom all the way from Minnesota because he knows that she willstand up to the out-of-touch anti-jobs activists trying to kneecap America'senergy production. Stauber understands that Alaska's current congresswoman,Mary Peltola, is a rubber-stamp Democrat who has supported the Biden-Harrisadministration's radical anti-American energy agenda. Mary Peltola stood byand supported Joe Biden as he signed over 60 executive orders targetingAlaska's energy exploration and production. In May, Stauber stepped in to leadthe Alaska's Right to Produce Act, after Mary Peltola abandoned her ownlegislation and encouraged fellow Democrats to vote against the pro-Alaskaenergy bill. ""Alaska and Minnesota have faced an onslaught of anti-mining andanti-energy policies that have done nothing but destroy domestic energyproduction and drive prices up,"" Rep. Pete Stauber said. ""It is my honor tostand up for Alaska's--and America's--energy future and that's why I'm joiningPresident Trump and supporting Alaska's Lt. Governor, Nancy Dahlstrom, to betheir sole congressional representative."" In response to the endorsement, Lt.Governor Nancy Dahlstrom, who was also endorsed by President Donald J. Trump,said: ""I am proud to have Congressman Stauber's endorsement in this criticalrace. Congressman Stauber stepped up for Alaska when our own Congresswomanturned her back on our state.

As I step off the stage ofthis year's historic DNC, there is one thing that couldn't be clearer: Ifwe're going to win both the White House and the Senate, we NEED to win inNevada – but we're facing an uphill battle against the deep pockets of theGOP. That's why I couldn't wait a second to humbly reach out: Will you pleasechip in $5 or more right now to help my good friend Jacky Rosen secure avictory in her must-win Senate campaign in Nevada?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/rosenfornevada_email_0824?refcode=jtk4583-fr-text&amount;=5&amounts;=250,100,50,25,5 Jacky Rosen has been a tirelesschampion in the Senate for working families and our most fundamental freedoms.But right now, experts are calling her the ""most vulnerable"" woman in theentire Senate, and they're calling Nevada the ""most perilous"" battleground forDemocrats. I can tell you from experience: Nevada is going to come down to themargins. When I won in 2016 to become our country's first Latina senator, itwas by just 2.4%. And when I won reelection in 2022 to secure the Senate forDemocrats, it was by fewer than 8,000 votes – less than 5 votes per precinct!That's why dark money groups like the Koch network are pouring more than $25MILLION into Nevada to defeat Jacky and flip the state red for Donald Trump.And unfortunately, their spending is working. Polling shows Jacky locked in astatistical tie with her Trump-backed opponent, and The Cook Political Reporthas rated Nevada as a ""Toss-Up."" That's why I'm reaching out to ask for yourhelp in making sure Jacky reaches her $35,000 goal by tonight's midnightdeadline. Because if we're going to keep her seat, the Senate, and the WhiteHouse blue, we cannot afford to let her come up short of crucial fundraisinggoals like this one. So please, rush $5 or more right now to make sure JackyRosen can keep Nevada blue, defend the Senate for Democrats, and help sendKamala Harris and Tim Walz to the White House.https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/rosenfornevada_email_0824?refcode=jtk4583-fr-text&amount;=5&amounts;=250,100,50,25,5 Thank you, friend. ¡La lucha sigue!The fight continues!

Friend, Yet another poll is out on the New Mexico Senate race that shows us closing in on Martin Heinrich. Here’s what the latest poll shows: * We’re only six points down * Heinrich polling his lowest ever at only 40% * 21% of voters are undecided! Remember, this is a seat that the mainstream media is telling us was supposed to be safe blue, and the Democrats NEVER thought would be in danger. It is telling that a career politician like Heinrich—who has been in the Senate for over a decade—has 60% of voters in his “safe blue” state not ready or willing to vote for him! This is a clear sign that voters in New Mexico are fed up with the radical and destructive agenda he and the Biden-Harris regime have been pushing on us. It’s no wonder we outraised Heinrich last quarter and continue to close in on him! We have put New Mexico in play, friend—something the Left never saw coming. But closing the deal will require maintaining our momentum. The Democrats have a big surprise coming—IF you can continue to support us in this fight. We’re looking for 120 supporters to chip in within the next 36 hours to ensure we can keep the pressure on Heinrich and continue closing the gap. Can you spare a few bucks? CHIP IN NOW! Thank you again for your support! For New Mexico, Nella Domenici Republican for Senate ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici’s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella’s family’s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world’s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

If Jacky loses in Nevada, the GOP extremists will take back the majorityand enact their dangerous, out-of-touch agenda. We CANNOT let this happen.

It’s no secret that the race to control the House ofRepresentatives will be incredibly close, and it will be decided in swingdistricts just like IL-17. In fact, there’s a good chance the House will bewon or lost in Illinois. We need representatives like Eric, who has ourconstituents’ best interests at heart.

My former party came after me for the high crime ofstanding up to Hillary Clinton at the height of her power in 2016. A lot haschanged since then – for starters, I’m no longer a Democrat. Like so many, theDemocrat Party left me behind and became the Party of corporate elitists,warmongers, and anti-freedom propagandists.(In fact, I literally wrote thebook about doing what’s RIGHT for our country and LEAVING the Democrat Party!)The rot is too deep – it can’t be fixed, it must be driven out entirely.That’s why I’m sending you this email.

YES >> _NO >> We set this ambitious goal becausethis is a no-fail mission – we must defeat the Democrat elite at the ballotbox and send a powerful message that we, the people will not allow those whoare destroying our freedom to remain in power.

What we’ve accomplished isnothing short of remarkable. Because of the commitment of hundreds ofvolunteers, we’ve placed the property tax measure, Measure #4, on the ballotwith thousands of signatures to spare. But our work isn’t finished… As youknow, the opposition is doing everything they can to spread fear andmisinformation, just like they did in 2012. They’re pulling out the same oldplaybook — same organization, same chairman, same tactics — trying to scarepeople into voting against their own best interests. They’ve already spent$80,000 on polling to find the most effective way to mislead voters. But wehave something they don’t: the truth and the support of people like you. Ourmessage is straightforward: Measure #4 provides the property tax relief andreform we’ve been promised for years, all while maintaining local control andfull local funding. The only obstacle now is getting this message out to asmany people as possible, and for that, we need to raise funds quickly. This iswhere I’m asking for your help once again—not just to donate, but to spreadthe word to others who believe in this cause as much as you do.

We’re so close to making real change, but we can’t doit without your continued support. Thank you for believing in this cause andfor standing with us.

They nominated J.D. Vance for their Vice Presidential pick, and he’s been spending the month trying to mislead the American public about who he is. Let’s be clear: He’s as extreme as it gets. He wants to deny women their reproductive freedom, he opposes gun safety laws, and wants to do everything he can to forward Donald Trump’s MAGA agenda. Every speech he’s given since then is filled with lies and seeks to divide Coloradans. That’s not who we are. Tomorrow night, the Democratic National Convention begins, where we’ll show the American people what we’re all about: restoring our freedoms, making healthcare affordable, combating climate change, protecting our democracy, and so much more. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will also accept their historic nominations for President and Vice President, and then we will keep pushing hard through election day.

Lastnight, as we officially sent Vice President Harris and Governor Tim Walz totake on the Trump Vance ticket, there’s no time to waste. Electing Democratsup and down the ballot is the name of the game if we want to take back theHouse, maintain our Senate majority, and send VP Harris to the White Housewith the Congressional support she needs to enact policies that bring usforward, not drag us back.

995,Blue North Carolina - via Team Cooper,info@roycooper.com,🛑 STOP the QAnon threat to NC public schools 🛑,2024-08-18T17:40:13Z,2024,8,18,17,40,roycooper.com,"CNN: GOP nominee to run North Carolina public schools called for violence against Democrats, including executing Obama and Biden Peter — North Carolina Republicans have set out to completely undermine our public education system… and their nominee for Superintendent of Public Schools, Michele Morrow, would do exactly that. She’s denigrated our public school system, calling schools “socialism centers” and “indoctrination centers.” Not only is Morrow completely unqualified for the office of Superintendent, she has also promoted dangerous QAnon conspiracy theories and advocated for violence against Democratic politicians — including Presidents Obama and Biden and Governor Roy Cooper. So we weren’t surprised to learn that after attending Donald Trump’s January 6th rally, she filmed a video urging Trump to use military force to stay in power. Michele Morrow is too dangerous to gain ANY kind of political power. Peter, there is nothing more important than strengthening our public school system and ensuring that teachers have what they need to educate North Carolina’s next generation of leaders. That won’t happen if Michele Morrow wins. Democratic Superintendent nominee Mo Green has a record of service to NC public schools and is committed to investing in teachers and students. He has Roy’s full confidence — and now, we ALL need to step up to ensure he defeats his extremist opponent. Can you split a grassroots donation between our team and Mo Green’s campaign right now?

She should still be alive today. Many Black and marginalized Americans avoid calling the police when they’re undergoing difficult emergencies, because they fear police violence. Sonya Massey knew this, which is why after she called 911 during a mental health crisis, she asked police to not hurt her once they arrived. Her mother also previously told 911 dispatchers that Sonya was not dangerous, asking them not to send any police officers to Sonya’s home and saying ""I'm scared of the police."" **To save lives, we need alternative crisis responses that center care and safety -- not armed police who regularly kill Black Americans.** Instead of punitive and violent responses to crises, appropriately trained and unarmed health experts should be sent to support people experiencing health emergencies. That’s part of how we address the urgent crisis of racist police violence. **I’m a co-sponsor of Rep. Cori Bush’s _a_ , which re-envisions public safety and invests in public health alternatives to policing. Will you join me by signing on in support of this legislation?** | SIGN ON ---  In Congress, Cori Bush and I have advocated against ever-growing spending onpolice and military budgets, instead calling for much-needed investments inmarginalized communities. **We understand that spending more on police budgetsdoesn’t keep our communities safe. In fact, it keeps Black and browncommunities in fear of regular harassment and violence.**That’s why we need policies like the _People's Response Act_ , which would: * Create a Division on Community Safety within the Department of Health and Human Services to **coordinate non-carceral, non-punitive, health-centered investments in public safety**.  * Launch a **f****ederal first responders unit** to support states and local governments with emergency health crises.  * Provide $11 billion in grant funding for community-based organizations and state and local governments to **fund public safety and improve crisis response**.  * Establish a $2.5 billion First Responder Hiring Grant to create thousands of jobs and **provide funding for governments and organizations to hire emergency first responders** such as licensed social workers, mental health counselors, substance use counselors, and peer support specialists. My sister in service Congresswoman Cori Bush has been calling to end the harmsof our racist criminal legal system since she was on the streets of theFerguson Uprising as an activist and a nurse. Cori herself was violentlybrutalized by police while trying to help a woman with a medical emergency ata protest.Her lived experience, and the experiences of Black people across the country,shows why we must move funds away from state-sanctioned violence and insteadinvest in real public safety.**Please add your name in support of the _People's Response Act_ to help keepour communities safe from police violence and create true public safety forall of us.**Together, we’ll keep fighting back against systemic racism and dehumanization.Together, we can build a more just criminal legal system and a world thattruly values people’s safety and well-being.In solidarity,Rashida  * * *  ![](https://actionnetwork.org/user_files/user_files/000/021/804/original/Facebook.png)![](https://actionnetwork.org/user_files/user_files/000/021/806/original/Twitter.png) https://rashidaforcongress.com/  * * *  Rashida Tlaib for Congress PO Box 32777 Detroit, MI 48232 | Paid for by Rashida Tlaib for Congress --- | | Sent via ActionNetwork.org.

In response to her request for help, a police officer came and killed her in her home. Sonya Massey should still be alive. As the Movement for Black Lives wrote: “Calling for emergency services shouldn’t be a death sentence. But time and time again, police mishandle emergency situations, escalate to violence, and execute Black people.” Clearly, **our system of policing doesn’t keep people safe**. It disproportionately harms Black people, who often avoid calling the police when they are undergoing some of the most difficult emergencies. Sonya knew this, asking police when they arrived to not hurt her. No wonder polls show that 88% of Black Americans support hiring mental health professionals as non-police first responders to de-escalate mental health crises. We urgently need to pass policies like Rep. Cori Bush’s _People's Response Act_ , which would **transform our approach to public safety to center care, not criminalization**. If passed, this groundbreaking legislation would support local governments and community-based organizations in launching and scaling **public health alternatives to policing, including investing in unarmed emergency first responders** such as licensed social workers, mental health counselors, substance use counselors, and peer support specialists. **To help build a world where Black and marginalized people can call for help and not risk being murdered by police, please add your name in support of the _People's Response Act_ now.** | ADD YOUR NAME ---  My sister in service Cori Bush protested in the streets of Ferguson forhundreds of days with other community members who were outraged about thebrutal police murder of 18-year-old Michael Brown. They sparked the beginningof the movement for Black Lives, which is still demanding policies to preventpolice violence and ensure true public safety.**Like Sonya Massey and others killed by state-sanctioned violence, MichaelBrown should still be here today.** Instead we recently marked the tenthanniversary of his tragic murder. Cori Bush wrote: “In his name, we will neverstop fighting for justice, accountability, and an end to police brutality.”During the Ferguson Uprising, Cori was also violently brutalized by policewhile trying to bring a woman to paramedics to help with a medical emergency.She had previously been a nurse serving people with mental health crises,where she witnessed punitive responses that harmed the vulnerable people inher care.**As the first activist from the movement for Black lives to be elected toCongress, Cori Bush has led transformational policies to keep our communitiessafe from police violence and create true public safety for all of us.** Sheengaged with community groups around the country on the _People's ResponseAct_.Cori won’t serve her next term in Congress, since right-wing billionairestargeted her and bought her seat.

A conviction. Making history, Donald J. Trump became the first former U.S.President convicted of felony crimes. To be clear, this was a **RIGGED**conviction and nothing more than a pathetic attempt to keep him off theballot.
